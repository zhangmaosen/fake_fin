19
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm Martin Vieca, VP of Invest Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Veibah Taneja,

20
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and a number of other executives.

21
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published

22
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
at the same link as this webcast.

23
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and we will discuss our business outlook

24
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and make forward-looking statements.

25
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.

26
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Actual events and the other, the first time, we will discuss our business, and the first time,

27
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and we'll see you in the next one.

28
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question

29
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and one follow-up.

30
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But before we jump into Q1, Elon has some opening remarks.

32
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Elon?

33
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thanks, Martin.

34
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So, to recap, in Q1, we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp for the updated

35
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Model 3 in Fremont.

36
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There was, as people have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure, and a lot of

37
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
other water manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead.

38
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate

39
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the market.

40
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment,

41
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all-time high in

42
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business.

43
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead.

44
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It will increase.

45
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You know that it will.

46
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, significantly faster than the car business, as we expected.

47
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training

48
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
compute sequentially.

49
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In terms of the new product roadmap, there's been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle

50
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
line in the past several weeks.

51
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead.

52
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We've also had previously mentioned start of production in the second half of 2025.

53
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year.

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
platform, as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced

56
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So, it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.

58
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It will be made on our current production lines much more efficiently.

59
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to the full extent.

61
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Regarding FSD version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced

62
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
the new product, you can see the new product.

63
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And I strongly urge you to try it out.

64
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's profound.

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And the rate of improvement is rapid.

66
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything

67
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
from Hardware 3 on in North America.

68
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So, it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles.

69
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And we're seeing about half of people use it so far.

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And that percentage is increasing with each passing week.

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12.

72
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the vision-based approach with end-to-end neural networks is the right solution for scalable

74
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
autonomy.

75
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And it's really how humans drive.

76
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes.

77
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, naturally, cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system.

78
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's

79
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
easy to try out.

80
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And as we've announced, we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robot taxi or cyber cab in

81
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
August.

82
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

83
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Regarding AI compute, over the past few months, we've been actively working on expanding Tesla's

84
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
core AI infrastructure.

85
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
For a while there, we were training constrained in our progress.

86
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We are, at this point, no longer training constrained, and so we're making rapid progress.

87
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We've installed and commissioned, meaning they're actually working, 35,000 H100 computers, or

88
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
GPUs.

89
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
GPUs is the wrong word.

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They need a new word.

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I always feel like a wince when I say GPU, because it's not GPUs.

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's G-Sense for graphics and doesn't do graphics.

93
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But, anyway, roughly 35,000 H100s are active.

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year.

95
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And training, just for training.

96
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training.

97
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used.

98
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy roadmap.

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving version 12 and attest that that is

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time at that.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future.

102
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And I'll go back to something I said several years ago, that in the future, gasoline cars

103
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone.

104
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And that will become very obvious in hindsight.

105
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla

106
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
in the future.

107
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward

108
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to everything that we have planned ahead.

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thanks.

110
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

111
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And Aviva has some comments as well.

112
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thanks.

113
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You know, it's important to acknowledge what Elon said from our auto business perspective.

114
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We did see a decline in revenues quarter over quarter.

115
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And those were primarily because of seasonality on certain macroeconomic environment and the

116
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
other reasons which Elon had mentioned earlier.

117
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Auto margins declined from 18.9 to 18.5 percent, excluding the impact of Cybertruck.

118
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition

119
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
of revenue from auto park feature for certain vehicles in the US that previously did not

120
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
have that functionality.

121
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Additionally, while we did experience higher costs due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and

122
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives.

123
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model 3 RAM costs, the revenue from auto margins

124
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
improved slightly.

125
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Currently, normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close

126
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to that of Fremont.

127
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the team in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business.

129
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there

130
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us.

131
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Obviously seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want.

132
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We would prefer it the whole industry went all in.

133
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
On the demand front, we have undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price

134
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD, launching extremely attractive leasing

135
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
specials for the Model 3 in the US for $2.99 a month, and offering attractive financing options

136
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
in certain markets.

137
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We believe that our awareness activities paired with attractive financing will go a long way

138
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Our energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of

140
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
24.6%.

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023.

142
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability.

143
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors

144
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter over quarter.

145
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment

146
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in future projects, marketing, and other activities.

147
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter.

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between bills and

149
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
deliveries, as discussed before, and our elevated spend on capex across various initiatives,

150
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
including AI compute.

151
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We expect the inventory bill to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return

152
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to positive again.

153
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary

154
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
decision to reduce our headcount by over 10%.

155
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of 1 billion on an annual run rate

156
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
basis.

157
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We are also getting hyper-focused on capex efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity

158
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
in a more efficient manner.

159
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions, will help improve our overall

160
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI.

161
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In conclusion, the future is extremely bright, and the journey to get there while challenging

162
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
will be extremely rewarding.

163
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results.

164
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And we can open it up to Q&A.

165
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Thank you.

166
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay, let's start with investor Q&A.

167
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The first question is, what is the status of 4680?

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What is the current output?

169
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Lars?

170
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sure.

171
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
4680 production increased about 18-20% from Q4, reaching greater than 1k a week for Cybertruck,

172
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year, as we posted on X.

173
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2, as we

174
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
ramped a third of four lines in phase one, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory

175
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to make sure we're ahead of the ramp.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week over week, driven by yield improvements

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
throughout the lines, and production volume increases.

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So our goal, and we expect to do this, is to beat supplier costs of nickel-based cells by

179
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the end of the year.

180
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Thank you.

181
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The second question is on Optimus.

182
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So what is the current status of Optimus?

183
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are they currently performing any factory tasks?

184
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When do you expect to start mass production?

185
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:34,000
We are able to do simple factory tasks, or at least I should say factory tasks in the lab.

186
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
In terms of actually, we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the factory,

187
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
in the actual factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year.

188
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year.

189
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
These are just guesses.

190
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined.

191
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robot that is able to navigate reality and do tasks

192
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy.

193
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So that's what's going to happen.

194
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I think Tesla is best position of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production

195
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
with efficient inference on the robot itself.

196
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, this perhaps is a point that is worth emphasizing.

197
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Tesla's inference, AI inference efficiency is vastly better than anyone, any other company.

198
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There's no company even close to the inference efficiency of Tesla.

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We've had to do that because we were constrained by the inference hardware in the car.

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We'd never choice.

201
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But that will pay dividends in many ways.

202
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Thank you.

203
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The third question is, what is Tesla's current assessment of the pathway towards regulatory

204
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
approval for unsupervised FSD in the US?

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And how should we think about the appropriate safety threshold compared to human drivers?

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Sure.

207
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can start.

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There are a handful of states that already have adopted autonomous vehicle laws.

209
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
These states are paving the way for operations.

210
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
While the data for such operations guides a broader adoption of driverless vehicles.

211
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think Ashok can talk a little bit about our safety methodology.

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But we expect that these states and the work ongoing, as well as the data that we're providing,

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
will pave the way for a broad-based regulatory approval in the US, at least, and then other

214
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
countries as well.

215
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah.

216
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's actually been pretty helpful that other autonomous car companies have been cutting a

217
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
path through the regulatory jungle.

218
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But the, which is, so that's actually quite helpful.

219
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And they have obviously been operating in Tampa, Cisco for a while.

220
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I think they got approval for city of LA.

221
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So these, these approvals are happening rapidly.

222
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think if you've got at scale, it's a statistically significant amount of data that shows conclusively

223
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that the autonomous car has, let's say, half the accident rate of a human driven car.

224
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think that's difficult to ignore because at that point, stopping autonomy means killing

225
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
people.

226
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So, I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers provided

227
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
there is conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human driven car.

228
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And in my view, this will be much like elevators.

229
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Elevators used to be operated by a guy with a relay switch.

230
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But sometimes that guy would get tired or drunk or just make a mistake and share somebody in

231
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
half between flows.

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So now we just have, we just get in an elevator and press a button.

233
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
We don't think about it.

234
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In fact, it's kind of weird if somebody standing there with relay switch.

235
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That'll be how cars work.

236
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You just summon a car using your phone.

237
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You get in, it takes you to a destination, you get out.

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You don't even think about it.

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You don't even think about it.

240
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Just like an elevator.

241
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It takes you to your floor.

242
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's it.

243
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Don't think about how the elevator is working or anything like that.

244
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And something I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet.

245
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So you can think of like how Tesla, think of Tesla like some combination of Airbnb and

246
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Uber, meaning that there'll be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates

247
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
in the fleet.

248
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There'll be some number of cars and then there'll be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the

249
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
end user, but that end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want.

250
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And they can decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family or only

251
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
by five star users or by anyone.

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And at any time they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like an Airbnb.

253
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know, you could rent out your guest room or not anytime you want.

254
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So as our fleet grows, we have seven million cars going to nine million cars going to, you know,

255
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:05,000
eventually tens of millions of cars worldwide with a constant feedback loop every time something

256
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
goes wrong.

257
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That gets added to the training data and you get this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google

258
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
search has the sort of flywheel.

259
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's very difficult to compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking and Google's

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
getting that feedback loop.

261
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's the same with Tesla, but at a scale that is maybe difficult to comprehend.

262
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But ultimately, it would be tens of millions.

263
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So I think there's also some potential here for an AWS element down the road where if we've got very

264
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
powerful inference, you know, because we've got a hardware three in the cars, but now all cars are

265
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
being made with hardware four, hardware five is pretty much designed and should be in cars, hopefully towards the end of

266
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
next year.

267
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So there's a potential to have for the to run when the car is not moving to actually run distributed

268
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
inference.

269
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So kind of like AWS, but distributed inference like it takes a lot of computers to train an AI

270
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
model, but many orders of magnitude less compute to run it.

271
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So if you can imagine future paths where there's a fleet of 100 million Teslas and on average,

272
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
they've got like maybe a kilowatt of inference compute, that's 100 gigawatts of inference compute

273
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
distributed all around the world.

274
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's pretty hard to put together 100 gigawatts of AI compute.

275
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And even in an autonomous future where the car is perhaps used instead of being used 10 hours a

276
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
week is used 50 hours a week, that still leaves over 100 hours a week where the car inference

277
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
computer could be doing something else.

278
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it seems like it would be a waste not to use it.

279
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Ashur, do you want to chime in on the air process and safety?

280
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, we have multiple tiers of evaluating the safety.

281
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
For like every in any given week, we train hundreds of neural networks that can produce, you know,

282
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
different trajectories for how to drive the car.

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We replay them through the millions of clips that we have already collected from our users and our own QA.

284
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Those are like critical events, you know, like someone jumping out in front or like other critical events that

285
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
we have gathered database or many, many years.

286
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And we replay through all of them to make sure that we are net improving safety.

287
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And on top of it, we have simulation systems that also try to recreate this and test this in close-to-to fashion.

288
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Once all of this is validated, we give it to our own QA drivers.

289
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We have hundreds of them in different cities in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, New York, a lot of different locations.

290
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They are also driving this and collecting real world miles.

291
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And we have an estimate of what are the critical events.

292
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are there net improvement compared to the previous week's builds?

293
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And once we have confidence that the build is a net improvement, then we start shipping to early users, like 2,000 employees initially,

294
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that they would like get the build.

295
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
They will give feedback on like if it's an improvement or are they noting some new issues that we did not capture in our own QA process.

296
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And only after all of this is validated, then we go to external customers.

297
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And even when we go external, we have like live dashboards of monitoring every critical event that's happening in the fleet,

298
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
sorted by, you know, the criticality of it.

299
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So we are having a constant pulse on the builds quality and the safety improvement along the way.

300
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And then any failures like Elon alluded to, you'd get the data back, add it to the training, and that improves the model in the next cycle.

301
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So we have this like constant feedback loop of issues, fixes, evaluations, and then rinse and repeat.

302
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And especially with the new V2L architecture, all of this is automatically improving without requiring much engineering interventions,

303
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
in the sense that people, engineers don't have to be creative in like how they code the algorithms.

304
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It's mostly learning on its own based on data.

305
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So you see that, okay, we fail here, or like this is how a person shows this, how you drive this intersection or something like that.

306
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We get the data back, we add it to the neural network, and it learns from that training data automatically,

307
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
instead of some engineers saying that, oh, here you must rotate the steering wheel by this much or something like that.

308
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
There's no hard FFLs conditions.

309
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It's everything is neural network.

310
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It's very soft.

311
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's probabilistic.

312
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So it will adapt its probability distribution based on the new data that it's getting.

313
00:27:45,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah, and we do have some insight into how good the things will be in like, let's say three or four months, because we have advanced models that are far more capable than what is in the car, but have some issues with them that we need to fix.

314
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So they're like, there'll be a step change improvement in the capabilities of the car, but it'll have some quirks that need to be addressed in order to release it.

315
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
As Ashok was saying, we have to be very careful in what we release to the fleet or to customers in general.

316
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So like, if we look at say 12.4 and 12.5, which are really could arguably even be version 13 and version 14, because it's pretty close to total retrain of the neural nets.

317
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And in each case, or substantially different.

318
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So we have good insight into where the models, how well the car will perform in say three or four months.

319
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Yeah, it depends on the scaling loss.

320
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
People in the AI community generally talk about model scaling loss, where they increase the model size a lot, and then they have corresponding gains in performance.

321
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But we have also figured out scaling loss and other access.

322
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
In addition to the model size scaling, we can also have data scaling.

323
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You can increase the amount of data you use to train in your network and that also gives similar gains.

324
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And you can also scale up by training compute, you can train it for much longer and get more GPUs or more Dojo nodes.

325
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And that also gives better performance.

326
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And you can also have architecture scaling where you come up with better architectures that for the same amount of compute for produce better results.

327
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So a combination of model size scaling, data scaling, training compute scaling, and architecture scaling.

328
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We can basically accept like, okay, if the country is scaling based on this ratio, we can sort of predict future performance.

329
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Obviously, it takes time to do the experiments because it takes, you know, a few weeks to train.

330
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It takes a few weeks to collect tens of millions of video clips and process all of them.

331
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But you can estimate what's going to be the future progress based on the trends that we have seen in the past.

332
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And that generally held true based on the past data.

333
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay. Thank you very much.

334
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Let's go to the next question, which is, can we get an official announcement of the timeline for the $25,000 vehicle?

335
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I think we, Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks, but as we, as you mentioned, we're updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low cost vehicles in a more CapEx efficient way.

336
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That's our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible.

337
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity.

338
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And that's a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do this.

339
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yeah, we'll talk about this more on August 8th.

340
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So, but really the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet.

341
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation in history when that day happens, when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.

342
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Five million cars?

343
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yeah.

344
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
A little less.

345
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, Tesla's have one.

346
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah, we have, you know, it'll be seven million cars, you know, in a year or so.

347
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

348
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And then 10 million.

349
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And then, you know, eventually we're talking about tens of millions of cars.

350
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Not eventually, it's like, yeah, within the decades, several tens of millions of cars, I think.

351
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So, I think that's a great question.

352
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Thank you.

353
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?

354
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I can take that one too.

355
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Cybertruck hit 1k a week, just a couple weeks ago.

356
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP'd late last year.

357
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Of course, volume production is what matters.

358
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's what drives costs.

359
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And so our costs are dropping.

360
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, etc.

361
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And we'll continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.

362
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Okay, thank you.

363
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?

364
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We're in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.

365
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Thank you.

366
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
The next question is about the robot taxi unveil.

367
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Elon already talked about that, so we'll have to wait till August.

368
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The following question is about the next generation vehicle.

369
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We already talked about that.

370
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So let's go to the semi.

371
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What is the timeline for scaling semi?

372
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I think.

373
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
True.

374
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So we're finalizing the engineering of the semi to enable like a super cost effective high volume production with our learnings from our fleet and pilot, our pilot fleet and Pepsi's fleet, which we're expanding this year marginally.

375
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
In parallel, as we showed in the shareholders that we have started construction on the factory in Reno.

376
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 with external customer reach starting in 2026.

377
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Okay, couple more questions.

378
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So our favorite, can we make FSD transfer permanent until FSD is fully delivered with level five autonomy?

379
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No.

380
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay, next question.

381
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
What is the getting, what is getting the production ramp at Lathrop?

382
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Where do you see the Megapack run rate at the end of the year?

383
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Mike?

384
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah.

385
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, Lathrop is ramping as planned.

386
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:49,000
We have our second GA line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 gigawatt hours per year to at the start of this year to 40 gigawatt hours per year by the end of the year.

387
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's that line is commissioned.

388
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
There's really nothing limiting the ramp.

389
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Given the longer sales cycles for these large projects, we typically have order visibility 12 to 24 months prior to ship date.

390
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So we're able to plan the build plan several quarters in advance.

391
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So this allows us to ramp the factory to align with the business in order growth.

392
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Lastly, we'd like to thank our customers globally for their trust in Tesla as a partner for these incredible projects.

393
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Okay, thank you very much.

394
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's go to analyst questions.

395
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The first question comes from Tony Sakunagi from Bernstein.

396
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Tony, please go ahead and unmute.

397
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Thank you for taking the question.

398
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today.

399
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Are these like tweaks on existing models, given that they're going to be running on the same lines or these like new models?

400
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And how should we think about them, you know, in the context of like the Model 3 Highland update?

401
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What will these models be like relative to that?

402
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And given the quick timeframe, you know, Model 3 Highland is required a lot of work and a lot of retooling.

403
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Maybe you can help put that all in context.

404
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Thank you.

405
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And I have a follow up, please.

406
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think we've said all we will on that front.

407
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So what's your follow up?

408
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you're leading many important companies right now.

409
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests.

410
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?

411
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Well, Tesla constitutes a majority of my work time.

412
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I work pretty much every day of the week.

413
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.

414
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So I can make sure Tesla is very prosperous.

415
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And it is like it is prosperous and it will be very much so in the future.

416
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay, thank you.

417
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.

418
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Adam, please go ahead and unmute.

419
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay, great.

420
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, Elon.

421
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate, notably lower than that achieved in 2023.

422
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But what's your team's degree of confidence on growth above 0% or, in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year on year?

423
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No, I think we'll have higher sales this year than last year.

424
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay, my follow up, Elon, on future product.

425
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next gen, cheaper vehicles, you know, more aggressive giga castings.

426
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unbox, 300 mile range, $25,000 price point.

427
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Putting aside RoboTaxi, those features unique to you.

428
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:21,000
How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years from now?

429
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that?

430
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Thanks.

431
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I mean, I don't know what our competitors could do, except we've done relatively better than they have.

432
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You know, if you look at the drop in our competitors in China's sales versus our drop in sales, our drop is less than theirs.

433
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So we're doing well.

434
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:59,000
But, you know, I think, you know, Cathy would say it best, like, really, we should be thought of as an AI robotics company.

435
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,000
If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, you would just have to fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework.

436
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible.

437
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So, I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.

438
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Like that is, but we will, and we are.

439
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,000
And then you have a car that goes from 10 hours of use a week, like an hour and a half a day, to probably 50.

440
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But it costs the same.

441
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I think that's the key thing to remember, right?

442
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Especially if you look at FSD Supervised, if you didn't believe in autonomy, they should give you a preview that this is coming.

443
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's actually getting better day by day.

444
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, if you've not tried the FSD 12.3, and like I said, 12.4 is going to be significantly better than 12.5, even better than that.

445
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And we have visibility into those things, then you really don't understand what's going on.

446
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's not possible.

447
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yeah, and that's why we can't just look at just as a car company, because a car company would just have a car.

448
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But here we have more than a car company, because the cars can be autonomous.

449
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And like I said, it's happening.

450
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah.

451
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
This is all in addition to Tesla.

452
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's working.

453
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The overall AI community is just increasing, like improving rapidly.

454
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, yeah, I mean, we're putting the actual auto in automobile.

455
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So, you know, so sort of like, well, sort of like, tell us about future horse carriages you're making.

456
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm like, well, actually, it doesn't need a horse.

457
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That's the whole point.

458
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's really the whole point.

459
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Okay, thank you.

460
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.

461
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Alex, please go ahead and unmute.

462
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Great, thanks.

463
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah, so couldn't agree more.

464
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,000
The thesis hinges completely on AI, the future of AI, full self-driving, you know, neural net training, all of these things.

465
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
In that context, Elon, you've spoken about your desire to obtain 25% voting control of the company.

466
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I understand completely why that would be.

467
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So I'm not necessarily asking about that.

468
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm asking if you've come up with any mechanism by which you can ensure that you'll obtain that level of voting control.

469
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Because if not, then the core part of the thesis could potentially be at risk.

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So any additional commentary you might have on that topic?

471
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Well, I think no matter what, Tesla, you know, even if I get kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy, maybe a little slower, but it would solve autonomy for vehicles at least.

472
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know if it would win on with respect to Optimus or with respect to future products.

473
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But it would, but there's not momentum for Tesla to solve autonomy, even if I disappeared for vehicles.

474
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Now there's a whole range of things we can do in the future.

475
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Beyond that, I'd be more reticent with respect to Optimus.

476
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:53,000
You know, if we have a super sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and that you can't escape, you know, we're talking Terminator level risk, then, yeah, I'd be uncomfortable with, you know, if there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed.

477
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And, you know, if there's shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or re-ratify the sort of competition, I guess I can't say that.

478
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But that is a fact, they have an opportunity.

479
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Okay.

480
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Very good.

481
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And, yeah, we'll see.

482
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
If the company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.

483
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
All right.

484
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's actually all very helpful context.

485
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Thank you.

486
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Maybe one final question, then I'll pass it on.

487
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there.

488
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions.

489
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:51,000
What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks?

490
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Thanks very much.

491
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So, you know, like we said, we've done these headcount reductions across the board.

492
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And, you know, as companies grow over time, you know, there are certain redundancies, there's some duplication of efforts, which happens in certain areas.

493
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So you need to go back and look at where all these pockets are, get rid of it.

494
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:25,000
So we're basically going through that exercise, where we're like, hey, how do we how do we set this company right for the next phase of growth?

495
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And the way to think about it is, you know, any tree which grows, it needs pruning.

496
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
This is the pruning exercise which we went through.

497
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And at the end of it, we'll be much stronger and much more resilient to deal with the future, because the future is really bright.

498
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Like I said in my opening remarks, we just have to get through this period and get there.

499
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, we're not giving up anything that is significant that I'm aware of.

500
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So we've just we've had a long period of prosperity from 2019 to now.

501
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And, you know, so if a company sort of organizationally is 5% wrong per year, you know, that accumulates to 2019.

502
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
25, 30 percent of inefficiency.

503
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:24,000
We've made some corrections along the way, but but it is it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth.

504
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And you really need to reorganize it just like a, you know, a human when we start off with one cell and kind of zygote and a blastocyst and you start growing arms and legs and briefly you have a tail.

505
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And, you know, so.

506
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But you shed the tail.

507
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You shed the tail, hopefully.

508
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And then you're a baby.

509
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And then you're a baby.

510
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And you, you know, you basically you have to be different.

511
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
The organism, a company is kind of like a creature growing.

512
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And if you don't reorganize it for different phases of growth, it will fail.

513
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You can't have the same organizational structure if you're, you know, 10 cells versus 100 versus a million versus a billion versus a trillion.

514
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You know, where humans are like around 35 trillion cells.

515
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It doesn't feel like it feels like, you know, like one person, but.

516
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:36,000
But, you know, you're basically a walking cell colony of roughly 35 trillion, depending on your body mass and about three times that number in bacteria.

517
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, anyway, you've got to reorganize the company for a new phase of growth or it will fail to achieve that growth.

518
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Thank you.

519
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.

520
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Mark, please go ahead and unmute.

521
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes.

522
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Good afternoon.

523
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Thanks very much for taking the question.

524
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
The company had previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions as in the early phase and some OEMs had not really been believing that.

525
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
had not really been believing in it.

526
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed?

527
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?

528
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, I think we just need to, it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach.

529
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And I think it is.

530
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I think we're now with 12.3.

531
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:45,000
If you just have the car drive you around, it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self driving.

532
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
No light hours, no radars, no ultrasonic, nothing.

533
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Just no heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.

534
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, it's so really just be a case of, you know, having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software.

535
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And, but, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's once becomes obvious that if you don't have this in a car, nobody wants your car.

536
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yeah.

537
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
It's like, it's a smart car.

538
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And, you know, I mean, I still remember like back when Nokia was king of the hill.

539
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah, yeah, crushing and, and, and, and then I slowly come out with a smartphone that was basically a brick with limited functionality.

540
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And then, you know, the iPhone and Android.

541
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But people still did not understand that all the phones are going to be that way.

542
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
There's not going to be any flip phones.

543
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
If there'll be a niche product or home phones.

544
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Yeah, not even exactly.

545
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
When was the last time you saw a home phone?

546
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I have no idea.

547
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah.

548
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
In a hotel, sometimes in a hotel.

549
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Yeah, the hotel's home.

550
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah.

551
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So, if people don't understand all cars will need to be smart cars, or they, or, or you will not sell this, the car will not, nobody will buy it.

552
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Once that becomes obvious, I think, licensing becomes not optional.

553
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It becomes a method of survival.

554
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah, it's licensed or nobody will buy your car.

555
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I mean, one other thing which I'll add is, in the conversations which we've had with some of these OEMs, I just want to also point out that they take a lot of time in their product lifecycle.

556
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, they're talking about years before they will, you know, put it in their product.

557
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
They might, we might have a licensing deal earlier than that, but it takes a while.

558
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So this is where the big difference between us and them is.

559
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Right?

560
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, I mean, really, a deal signed now would result in it being in a car probably three years.

561
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Something like that.

562
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That would be OEM.

563
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, that's like lightning, basically.

564
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So that's being an eager OEM.

565
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah.

566
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we do sign a deal.

567
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think we're good chance we do sign a deal this year.

568
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Maybe more than one.

569
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But yeah, it would be probably three years before it's integrated with a car, even though all you need is cameras and our inference computer.

570
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So, it's like not a massive design change.

571
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yeah, and again, just to clarify, it's not the work which we have to do, it's the work which they have to do.

572
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah.

573
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Mark, do you have a follow-up?

574
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah, very helpful.

575
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Thank you.

576
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward.

577
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand.

578
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
With how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place,

579
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products?

580
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free capital positive on an annual basis with the current products up?

581
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Thanks.

582
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, I think we can be free capital positive meaningfully.

583
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah.

584
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I think Vibe offset it in its opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cuts.

585
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
That's not what it's going to go.

586
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Like we're trying to give it back to the customers.

587
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah.

588
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I mean, at the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price, the sales, if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent.

589
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
That's true of any arena.

590
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So over time, we do need to keep making sure that we're, that it's a great product at a great price, and moreover, that that price is accessible to people.

591
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's not, you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question.

592
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The fundamental affordability question is sometimes overlooked.

593
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
If somebody is earning hundred, several hundred thousand dollars a year, they don't think of a car from a fundamental affordability standpoint.

594
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But from vast majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck.

595
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So it actually makes difference if the, if the cost per month for lease or financing is $10 one way or the other.

596
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So it is important to keep improving the affordability and to, and to keep, this is like making the price.

597
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
More accessible.

598
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

599
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep, keep improving that over time.

600
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
But also the main kick-ass cost that people want to buy.

601
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, it's gotta be a great product at a great price.

602
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And, and the, the, the standards for what constitutes a great product at a great price, keep, keep increasing.

603
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So there's like, you can't just be static.

604
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You have to keep saying, keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production.

605
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And that's what we're doing.

606
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah. And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised, the updated model three is a fantastic car.

607
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't think people fully even understand the amount of engineering effort, which has gone.

608
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different when it looks and feels different.

609
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
When it looks and feels different.

610
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Not only looks and feels different.

611
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
We've added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as 299 a month.

612
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yeah.

613
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Without gas.

614
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

615
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Right.

616
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The next question comes from a George from Canaccord.

617
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
George, please go on, unmute.

618
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Hi.

619
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Thank you for taking my question.

620
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
First, can you please help us understand some of the timing of the data?

621
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Can you please understand some of the timing of launching FSD in additional geographies, including maybe clarifying your recent comment about China?

622
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Thank you.

623
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I mean, like new markets.

624
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah, we are.

625
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There are a bunch of markets where we don't currently sell cars that we should be selling cars in.

626
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We'll see some acceleration of that.

627
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And FSD in new markets?

628
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah.

629
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The thing about the end-to-end neural net based autonomy is that just like a human, it actually works pretty well without modification in almost any market.

630
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So we plan on, with the approval of the regulators, releasing it as a supervised autonomy system in any market that work that where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China.

631
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So, yeah, it's just like a human, you can go rent a car in a foreign country and you can drive pretty well.

632
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Obviously, if you live in that country, you'll drive better.

633
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And so we, you know, we'll make the car drive better in these other countries with country-specific training.

634
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But it can drive quite well almost everywhere.

635
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, the basics of driving are basically the same everywhere.

636
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Like, you know, a car is a car, a car is a traffic light, a road is a road.

637
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah.

638
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It understands that it shouldn't hit things no matter where it is.

639
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Exactly.

640
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
There are some road rules that you need to follow.

641
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And in China, you shouldn't cross over a solid line to do a lane change.

642
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
The US is a recommendation, I think.

643
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
China, yeah, you get fined heavily if you do that.

644
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:56,000
We have to do some reductions, but it's mostly smaller reductions, not like the entire change of stack or something like that.

645
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah.

646
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Hey, George, do you have a follow-up?

647
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yeah, so my follow-up has to do with the first quarter deliveries.

648
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And I'm curious as to whether or not you feel that supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results.

649
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
And maybe can you help us quantify that?

650
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in 2024?

651
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Yeah, I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks, too.

652
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You know, Q1 had a lot of different things which were happening.

653
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You know, seasonality was a big one.

654
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment.

655
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
We had attacks at our factory.

656
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
We had Red Sea attacks.

657
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
We were ramping Model 3.

658
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
We were ramping model Cybertruck.

659
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
All these things are happening.

660
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period.

661
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And that gives us that confidence that, hey, we don't expect these things to break.

662
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah, we think Q2 will be a lot better.

663
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah.

664
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It's just one thing after another.

665
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah, our sanitizers are crazy.

666
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

667
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It's just, if you've got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot be delivered to people.

668
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:23,000
And if you've got, you know, excess demand for, you know, Model 3 or Model Y in one market, but you don't have it there.

669
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's like, it's quite a logistic, it's extremely complex logistics situation.

670
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So, you know, I'd say also the, we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we've just in the past week or so have greatly simplified.

671
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:54,000
So, the, it just, it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be, you can buy the car in under a minute.

672
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:05,000
So, we're getting back to the, you can buy a Tesla in under a minute interface from what was quite complex.

673
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Okay, thank you.

674
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Let's go to Colin Rush from Oppenheimer.

675
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Colin, go ahead and unmute, please.

676
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Thanks so much, guys.

677
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You know, given, you know, the pursuit of Tesla really as a leader in AI for the physical world, and your comments around distributed inference, can you talk about what that approach is, is unlocking beyond what's happening in the vehicle right now?

678
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Do you want to say something?

679
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah, I can't even mention like the car even when it's a full robot taxi, that's probably going to be used for 50 hours a week.

680
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
That's my guess, like a third of the hours a week.

681
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Yeah, it could be more or less, but then there's certainly going to be some hours left for charging and cleaning and maintenance.

682
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And that, well, it can do a lot of other workloads.

683
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Even right now we are seeing, for example, these LLM companies have this batch workloads where they send a bunch of documents.

684
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And those are run through pretty large neural networks and take a lot of, you know, compute to jump through those workloads.

685
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it might be wise to use them and not let them be idle, be like buying a lot of expensive machinery and letting them be idle.

686
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
We don't want that.

687
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,000
We want to use the compute as much as possible and close to like basically 100% of the time to make effective use of it.

688
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That's why I think it's analogous to Amazon Web Services, where, you know, people didn't expect that AWS would be the most valuable part of Amazon when it started out as a bookstore.

689
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So that was on nobody's radar.

690
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:54,000
But they found that they had excess compute because the compute needs would spike to extreme levels for brief periods of the year.

691
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And then they had idle compute for the rest of the year.

692
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So then what should they do with all that excess compute for the rest of the year?

693
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
That's kind of monetize it.

694
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, monetize it.

695
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:21,000
So it seems like kind of a no brainer to say, okay, if we've got millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there, where the computers are idle most of the time, that we might as well have them do something useful.

696
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Exactly.

697
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:37,000
And then I mean, if you get like to the 100 million vehicle level, which I think we will at some point get to, then, and you've got a kilowatt of usable compute, and maybe your own hardware, six or seven by that time.

698
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Then you really, I think you could have on the order of 100 gigawatts of usable compute, which might be more than anyone, more than any company, probably more than any company.

699
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, probably, because it takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway.

700
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And when it's not driving the car, you just put this intelligence to other users, solving the scientific problems.

701
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Just like a human.

702
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Or answering dump questions, of course.

703
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Someone else.

704
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
We've already learned a lot about deploying workloads to these compute nodes.

705
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Yeah.

706
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And unlike laptops and our cell phones, it is totally under Tesla's control.

707
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So it's easier to distribute the work product across different nodes, as opposed to, you know, asking users for permission on their own cell phones would be very tedious.

708
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Well, you just drain the battery on the phone.

709
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

710
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The battery is also under.

711
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:36,000
So, like, technically, I suppose, like, Apple would have the most amount of distributed compute, but you can't use it because you can't get the, you can't just run the phone at full power and drain the battery.

712
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yeah.

713
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So, whereas for the car, even if you're a kilowatt level inference computer, which is crazy power compared to a phone, you know, if you've got a 50 or 60 kilowatt hour pack, it's still not a big deal.

714
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Not a big deal to run.

715
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So, if you're plugged in.

716
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Whether you're plugged in or not.

717
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Whether you're plugged in or not.

718
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
You can be plugged in or not plugged in.

719
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You know, you could run for 10 hours and use 10 kilowatt hours of your kilowatt of compute.

720
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
For how?

721
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah.

722
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
We're together built in liquid-cold thermal management.

723
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Yeah, it's exactly.

724
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Expense for data centers.

725
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So, it's already there in the car.

726
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Exactly.

727
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah.

728
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So, it's distributed power generation.

729
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
It's just distributed access to power and distributed cooling.

730
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And it's already paid for.

731
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeah.

732
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I mean, that distributed power and cooling, people underestimate that cost a lot of money.

733
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Yeah.

734
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And the CapEx is shared by the entire world.

735
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yes.

736
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Sort of.

737
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Everyone wants a small chunk and they get a small profit out of it.

738
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah.

739
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Thanks so much, guys.

740
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And just my follow up is a little bit more mundane.

741
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you are to target yields and when

742
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?

743
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You know, we're making good progress on that.

744
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:12,000
But I don't think it's super important for at least the near term.

745
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:20,000
As Laura said, we think it will be, you know, exceed the competitiveness of suppliers by the end of this year.

746
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And then we'll continue to improve it.

747
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah.

748
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I mean, I think it's important to note also that like the ramp right now is relevant to the Cybertruck ramp.

749
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah.

750
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And so like we're not going to just randomly build 4680s unless we have a place to put them.

751
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And so we're going to, you know, make sure we're prudent about that.

752
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
But we also have a lot of investments with all our cell suppliers and vendors.

753
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
They're great partners and they, you know, have done great development work with us.

754
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And a lot of the advancements in technology and chemistry we found 4680, they're also putting into their cells.

755
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah, I mean, a big part of the 4680, it tells us doing internal cells was a hedge against how us what would happen with our suppliers.

756
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Because for a while there, it was very difficult because every big car maker put in massive battery orders.

757
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And so the prices the price per kilowatt hour of a battery of lithium batteries went to crazy numbers, crazy levels.

758
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Bonkers.

759
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yeah, just bonkers.

760
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Bonkers.

761
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So like, okay, we've got to have some hedge here to deal with, you know, cost per kilowatt hours numbers that would double what we anticipated.

762
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:38,000
If we have an internal cell production, then we have that hedge against demand shocks.

763
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
There was too much demand.

764
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
That's really the way to think about it.

765
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems that just for the hell of it.

766
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We did this health program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every car maker on Earth.

767
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So, okay, thank you.

768
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And the last question comes from Ben Kalo from Baird.

769
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Ben, go ahead and unmute.

770
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And you're still muted.

771
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FST 12.3.

772
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You really, you can't, it's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.

773
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
All right.

774
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So, since Ben is not unmuting, let's try Shreyas Patel from Wealth Research.

775
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Final question.

776
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh, hey.

777
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Thanks so much.

778
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Just, you know, Elon, during the investor day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current 3&Y.

779
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS.

780
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
About a third of that was coming from the unbox manufacturing process.

781
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But I'm curious if you see an opportunity that the other, some of the other, some of the other drivers around powertrain cost reduction or material cost savings, would those be largely transferable to some of the new products that you're, that you're now talking about, about introducing?

782
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

783
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I mean, in short, yes.

784
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I mean, like, you know, the unboxing manufacturing method is certainly great and revolutionary, but with it comes some risk because, you know, it's new production lines or not.

785
01:05:45,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But all the subsystems we developed, whether it was powertrains, you know, drive units, battery improvements in manufacturing and automation, thermal systems, seating, integration of interior components and reduction of LV controllers, all that's transferable.

786
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And that's what we're doing, you know, trying to get it in their products as fast as possible.

787
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And so, so I, yeah, that engineering work, we're not trying to just throw it away and put, you know, in a coffin.

788
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,000
We're going to take it and utilize it and utilize it to the best advantage of the cars we make and the future cars we make.

789
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Okay, great.

790
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And then just on, on that topic of 4680 cells, I know you mentioned it, you really thought of it more as like a hedge against, against, you know, rising battery costs from other OEMs.

791
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But it seems, you know, even today, you know, it seems like you would have a cost advantage against some of those other automakers.

792
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And I'm wondering, you know, given the rationalizing of your vehicle manufacturing plans that you're talking about now, if there's an opportunity to maybe, you know, convert the 4680 cells and maybe sell those to other automakers and really generate an additional revenue stream.

793
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that.

794
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Great. What seems to be happening is that the, unless I'm missing something, the orders for batteries from other automakers have declined dramatically.

795
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So we're seeing much more competitive prices for sales from our suppliers, dramatically more competitive than in the past.

796
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So, it is clear that a lot of our suppliers have excess capacity.

797
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yeah. In addition to what Elon said, this is Karim, by the way.

798
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
In addition to what Elon said about 4680s, what 4680 did for us from a supply chain perspective was help us understand the supply chain that's upstream of our cell suppliers.

799
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So a lot of the deals that we had struck for 4680, we can also supply those materials to our partners, help reducing the overall cost back to Tesla.

800
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
So we're basically inserting ourselves in the upstream supply chain by doing that.

801
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:01,000
So that's also been beneficial in reducing the overall pricing in addition to the excess capacity that these suppliers have.

802
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Yeah. Now, I mean, this is going to wax and wane, obviously.

803
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So, you know, there's going to be a boom and bust in battery cell production, you know, where production exceeds supply and then supply exceeds production and back and forth, kind of like DRAM or something.

804
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But, you know, so it's like what is true today will not be true in the future.

805
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
There's going to be somewhat of a boom and bust cycle here.

806
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And then there are additional complications by, you know, with government incentives.

807
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Like the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA.

808
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Which always found like a funny name for a...

809
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Chemical name.

810
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yeah. It's like the Irish Republican Army.

811
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
The Internet Research Agency from Russia.

812
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Independent Retirement Bank.

813
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

814
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Roth IRA.

815
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:07,000
There's like a force vitamin situation, which IRA wins.

816
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:13,000
So, but it does, it does complicate the incentive structure.

817
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So that there's, there is perhaps, there's the stronger demand for sales that are produced in the US than outside the US.

818
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
But then how long does that, the IRA last?

819
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I don't know.

820
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Which is why it's important that we have both in our sales and lender sales to hedge against all of this.

821
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yeah.

822
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Okay.

823
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Thank you very much.

824
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That's all the time we have today.

825
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
But at the same time, I would like to make a short announcement.

826
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And I wanted to let the investment community know that about a month ago, I met up with Elon and Vibeoff

827
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and announced that I'll be moving on from the world of investor relations.

828
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I'll be hanging around for another couple of months or so.

829
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
So feel free to reach out anytime.

830
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
But after this seven year sprint, I'm going to be taking a break and spending some good quality time with my family.

831
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And I wanted to say that the seven years have been the greatest privilege of my professional life.

832
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I'll never forget the memories from, I started literally at the beginning of production hell.

833
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And just watching the company from the inside to see what it's become today.

834
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And I'm especially super thankful to the people in this room and dozens of people outside of this room that I've worked for over the years.

835
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I think that the team strength and team work at Tesla is unlike anything else I've seen in my career.

836
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Elon, thank you very much for this opportunity that I got back in 2017.

837
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Thank you for seeking investor feedback and regularly and debating it with me.

838
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, well, I mean, the reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I'd seen.

839
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Thank you.

840
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So, yeah, thank you for helping Tesla get to where it is today over seven years.

841
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It's been a pleasure working with you.

842
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Thank you so much.

843
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And yeah, thank you for all the thousands of shareholders that we've met over the years and walked around factories and loved all the interactions,

844
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
even with even the tough ones.

845
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And yeah, looking forward to the call in the next three months.

846
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But I'll be on the other side listening in.

847
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Thank you very much.

848
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Thanks.

849
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Thanks.

850
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
To be clear here, with Leslie.

851
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Thank you

852
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000

You always stay.

854
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
No, you always stay.

855
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Please be careful you don't become too supportive.

856
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Never지, let your engagement Oj Hogresso get a listen to different parts from the side.
