Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so. Thank you so much, my integrators, and your roadmap for E binary. And thank you for having me. Thank you. the neural network, the data, the training compute, etc. By Q2 next year, we should cross over the average human minds for critical intervention, public collision in that case. I mean, that is just unbonished our internal estimate. Yes. Yeah. So that's not a sandbag or anything else. Our internal estimate is Q2 of next year to be safer than human. And then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter. But to now look at it. But the vast majority of humanity has no idea that puzzles can drive themselves. So especially for something like a Model 3 or Model Y, it looks like a normal car. So. You don't expect a normal car to be able to be intelligent enough to drive itself. Yes, a cab looks different. So a truck looks different. But Model Y and Model 3 are look, they're good looking cars, but look fairly normal. You don't expect a fairly normal looking car to have the intelligence and enough A.I. to be able to drive itself. But it does. So we do want to expose that to more people. And and so we're doing. We're doing. Every time we have a significant improvement in the software, we'll roll out another 30 day trial. So to encourage people to try it again. And we are seeing a significant improvement in adoption. So the the take rate for FSD is improved substantially, especially after the 1010 event. Um. Yeah. So it's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. It's. There's no need to wait for a robot taxi or side of a cab or to experience full autonomy. We expect to achieve that next year with the with our existing vehicle line. Um, I wanted to actually spot someone gives a small taste of what it's going to look like the car able to drive itself to the user within private parking lots. Currently, it's speed limited, but then it's going to quickly be increased. I've already had more than a million. usage himself, a smart summon. Yep. So and we actually we have for Tesla employees in the Bay Area. We already are offering a ride handling capability so. So you can actually use with the development app, you can request a ride and it'll take you anywhere in the Bay Area. We do have a safety driver for now, but the software required to do that. We've we've developed and I mean David, you want to elaborate on that? Yeah, sure. David, we showed some screenshots of this in the Q1 shareholder deck and this is real. We've been testing it for the part of the year and the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it to production. We've been thinking about working on for years. It just so happens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers. In the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across cars so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's you know another car that you own or a car that somebody's loaned to you or a rental car that you jump into, it looks exactly like yours. Everything synchronized, seat mirror positions, you know, media navigation, everything is the same. Just what you would expect from one of our robotaxis. But you know, we gave that functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used in the future. So we're really excited about that. And we're looking forward to seeing what we can do with that. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. So we're releasing that functionality now. All the end to end cybersecurity that we knew we were going to need to deliver that functionality, sending a navigation to destination from your phone to the vehicle. And so you know, you're doing that now with the ride hailing app, but it's something that we've made available to customers for years. Seeing the progress on route in the mobile app, that's something you'll need for the ride hailing app. But again, we released it in the meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about that. Yeah, we're not going to be building out this stuff right now while we're building out, you know, the early stages of our ride hailing network. We've been thinking about this for quite a long time, and we're excited to get the functionality out there. Yeah, and we do expect to roll out ride hailing in California, Texas next year to the public. Now, California is somewhere there's quite a long regulatory approval process. But it shouldn't, I think we should get approval next year, but it's contingent upon regulatory approval. Texas is a lot faster, so it's, I'd say like, we'll definitely have it available in Texas, and probably have it available in California subject to regulatory approval. And then, and maybe some other states actually, next year as well, but at least California, Texas. So that'd be very exciting. That's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle. Yeah, I think that's a really profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle for the public. Yeah, I think that's a really profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of vehicle for the public. And, you know, battery manufacturing company at that point. So, we published a Q3 vehicle safety report, which shows one crash for every 700 miles of water pilot that can cause the US average water crash, roughly every 700,000 miles. So it's currently showing a 10x safety improvement relative to the US average. we continued to expand our training capacity to accommodate the needs of both FSD and Artemis. We're currently not, not a training computer constraint. That's probably the biggest limiting factors that the FSD is actually getting. So good that it takes us a while to actually find mistakes. When you start getting to where it could take 10,000 miles to find a, a mistake. It takes a while to actually figure out which it is. Is this a bolt? Is this a software bolt better than, is software bolt A better than software bolt B? It actually takes a while to figure it out because neither one of them are making mistakes. What takes a long time to make mistakes. So that's actually the single biggest limiting factor is how long does it take us to figure out which version is better. So that's sort of a high class problem. Obviously having a giant fleet is very helpful for breaking this out. And then with Optimus, we showed a massive improvement in Optimus' dexterity movement on October 10th and our next gen hand and forearm, which has 22 degrees of freedom, which is double the prior hand and forearm. It's extremely human-like. It also has much better tactile sensing. It's really, I feel confident saying that we have the most advanced humanoid robot by a long shot. And we're moreover the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale humanoid robots. Because the things that one of the other companies are missing is that they're missing the AI brain. They're missing the ability to really scale to very high volume production. So you don't see some impressive video demos, but they like the localized AI and the ability to scale volume to very high numbers. As I've said on a few occasions, but it's important to understand that when you're working with a robot, it's very hard to get the right kind of information, and you're not going to get the right kind of information, and that's not going to be the case for every robot. So we're trying to figure out how to make it work. So let's talk a little bit about the AI. So the AI is the ability to really scale to very high volume production, and it's a very popular technology. It's really important to realize that the AI is able to scale to very high volume production. As I've said on a few occasions before, I think Optimus will ultimately be the most valuable part of it. I think it has a good chance of being the most valuable product ever made. For the energy business, that's doing extremely well. And the offshore data head is gigantic. The Lathrop mega pack factory reached 200 mega packs a week, which is now a 40 gigawatt hour a year run rate. And we have a second factory in Shanghai that will begin with a 20 gigawatt hour a year run rate in Q1 next year, so just next quarter. And that'll also scale up. It won't be long before we're shipping 100 gigawatt hours a year stationary storage. That's the plan. And that'll ultimately grow, I think, to multiple terawatt hours per year. It has to, actually, in order to have a sustainable energy future. If you're not at the terawatt scale, you're not really moving the needle. So if you look at our really very complicated last master plan, which I think actually is too much. Do you know? Maybe I'll ask Gerard to analyze it and shorten it up. Yeah, give us the TLDR on the last master plan. We showed in that master plan that it is possible to take all of Earth to a fully sustainable energy situation using sustainable energy, power generation, and batteries and electric transport. And there are no fundamental material limitations. Like there's not some very rare. Material that we don't have enough of on Earth. We actually have enough of raw materials to. Take all of human civilization, make it fully sustainable. And even if civilization dramatically increased its electricity usage, it could still be fully sustainable. You know, one way to think of the progress of a civilization, it may sound a little esoteric, but. And that is, England had a whole lot of hard work to note, but it's very easily in a completely dreamlike. That's very easy to get to. Speaker 1 We just want to remind folks playing player in game. If you have a feeling you just go into the game. Stupid, professions, so how do you explain how different classes just plot different competitors in different ways? Oh God, I don't understand. No problem. We just wrap it up. Eric. . . . gracias. When you think in cartoship terms, it becomes obvious that by far the biggest source of energy is the sun. Everything else is in the noise. So in conclusion, Tesla is focused on building the future of energy, transport, robotics, and AI. And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near-term trends. We think what we're doing is the right approach. And if we execute on our objectives, and I think we will, my prediction is Tesla will become the most valuable company in the world, probably by a long shot. I want to thank the Tesla team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment, and we're looking forward to building an incredibly exciting future. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much, Elon. And I hope that Bob has some opening remarks as well. Thanks. Our Q3 results were overall positive, and once again, demonstrated the scale to which businesses evolved over the years with the generation of record operating cash flows of 6.3 billion. Our automotive revenues grew both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. While we had unit volume growth, we did experience reduction in ASPs, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw a significant increase in the cost of financing incentives. As a reminder, we are providing these incentives primarily using third-party banks and financial institutions and recognize the cost of these incentives as an upfront reduction to them. We released FSD for Cybertruck and other features like actually smart someone like Elon talked about in North America, which contributed 326 million of revenues in the quarter. We also saw a significant increase in the cost of credit sales, with over 2 billion of revenues so far this year. To expand on this, at an industry level, China continues to outperform the US and Europe by a factor of three. And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions as customers' acceptance of EV goals. And we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more competitive needs. Our focus remains on growing unit volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory. To support this strategy, we are continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in every market. When you compare any vehicle in our lineup with other OEMs, we believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features, performance, and unbalanced software functionalities like they would also talk about. Include also what Ashok had talked about around autonomy, music options, parental controls, and much more. While every vehicle in our lineup comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness gap, not just with buyers, but at times even with existing owners. We plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers. Automotive margins improved quarter over quarter, with over a third of the vehicles being available. And with the increase in sales of the vehicle, we have seen a significant increase in sales of cars. We believe this will be an important factor in the future, as well as in the future for consumers. And to support this strategy, we believe that is the right strategy to build affordable and more competitive needs. We believe that is the right strategy to build a vehicle that is more compatible with other vehicles. And to support this strategy, we believe margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of FSD feature release discussed before. Increase in our overall production and delivery volume, continued benefit from commodity pricing, and more localized deliveries in region, which resulted in lower freight and duties. Sustaining these margins in Q4 however will be challenging given the current economic environment. Note that we are focused on the cost per vehicle and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze our costs without compromising on customer experience. Yeah, something that's a helpful, hopefully a helpful macro trend is if there's a decline in interest rates, this has a massive effect on automotive demand. The vast majority of people, the demand is driven by the monthly payment. Can they afford the monthly payment? So we most likely will see continued decline in interest rates, which helps with affordability of vehicles. Yeah, I mean, that is one trend which we observed in the industry that, you know, because of affordability being impacted because of interest rates, people are holding on to their cars longer, especially in the U.S. And that is actually having an impact on the overall industry too. As we discussed earlier, as we discussed impact orders, energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to customer readiness, location of orders being fulfilled, and not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within the quarter. While we did see a decline in Q3, we expect to grow deployment sequentially in Q4 to end the year more than double of last year. Energy. Energy. Energy margins in Q3 quarter record at more than 30%. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter. Note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory. Our pipeline and backlog continue to grow quarter over quarter as we fill our 2025 production slots, and we are doing our level best to keep up with the demand. Just coming back on automotive margins. I talked about what is happening. One other thing which I want to also share is that we will continue to keep whatever we can. Like I said before about squeezing out the cost, but this is something which we also are very capable of. Just in Q3, we reached our lowest cost per vehicle. And that is attractive. This is a trend which we want to keep focus on. Then going on to service and other, we continue to show improvements in Q3. This was a result of better performance both in our service business, which includes collision, part sales, and merchandise, and continued growth in supercharging. These fleet-based revenues will continue to grow as the overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarter over quarter in a year-on-year basis. This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook. Cost saving from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to our AI efforts. We've started using the GPU cluster based out of our factory in Austin ahead of schedule. And I'm on track to get 50K GPUs deployed in Texas by the end of this month. One thing which I'd like to elaborate is that we're being very judicious on our AI compute spend too. And saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making any changes. And so we're working on the investments. On the CapEx front, we had over $3.5 billion in the quarter. This was a sequential increase largely because of investments in AI compute. We now expect CapEx for the year to be in excess of $11 billion. We shared our vision for the future at the V-robot event at the beginning of the month. The Tesla team is hyper-focused on delivering on that vision. Now all efforts are underway to make it a reality. And we've made significant progress this year. It will take time to get this as we pioneered new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmented regulatory landscape. The future is incredibly bright. And I want to thank the Tesla team once again for all they have. Great. Thank you very much, Vibhav. Now we'll go to investor questions. The first one is, is Tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year, as mentioned by Elon earlier? And how does it align with your AI product roadmap? Sure. I mean, as Elon and Vibhav both said, we are in plan to meet that in the first half of next year. Our mission has always been to lower the cost of our vehicles to increase the adoption of sustainable energy and transport. Part of that is lowering the cost of our current vehicles, which is where all of the personally owned vehicles that we sell today come in. But the next stage in that really as it fits into AI roadmap is when we bring in robotaxis, which lowers the initial cost of the vehicles. And that's really where we see the marriage of EV roadmap and the AI roadmap. Yeah. It'll be like with with with incentives of sub 30K, which is kind of a key threshold. Great. Thank you very much. Similar question next. When can we expect Tesla to give us the $25,000 non robotaxi regular car model? We're not making it on. All our vehicles today are robotaxi. I think we've made very clear that the future is autonomous. I mean, it's going to be. And I actually said this many years ago, but that my strong belief, and I believe that is panning out to be true. And it'll be very obvious retrospect is that the future is autonomous electric vehicles. And these non autonomous gasoline vehicles in the future will be like riding a horse and using a flip boat. It's not that there are no horses. Yeah, there are some horses, but they're unusual. They're niche. And. Yeah, so it's a really just everything's gonna be electric autonomous. I think this this is like it should be frankly, blindingly obvious at this point that that is the future. um so a lot of automotive companies most automotive companies have not not internalized this which is surprising um because we've been shouting this from the rooftops for such a long time um and it will accrue to their detriment in the future um but all of our vehicles in the future we will try this yes all the vehicles that we we've really made all the seven million vehicles the vast majority are capable of autonomy um and you know we're currently making on the order of 35 000 autonomous vehicles a week um if you compare that to say waymo's entire fleet it's less than they have less than a thousand cars we make 25k a week yeah and our cars look normal yeah they're mostly normal the cyber truck looks yes thankfully you know looks abnormal um and then the you know cyber cab slash robo taxi you know we wanted to have something futuristic looking i think it does look futuristic um it's worth noting with respect to the cyber cab it's not it's it's actually not just a revolutionary vehicle design but a revolution in vehicle manufacturing that was also coming with this with the cyber cab uh the cycle time like the the units per per hour of of the cyber cab line uh it is like this is just really something special i mean this is only yeah half order of magnitude better than other car manufacturing lines like like like like like not in the same league that's what i'm saying not on the same league um so so it's it's it's you know and i i said like several years ago that the maybe the most the hottest tesla product copy will be the boundary yeah just like by a factory um yeah you can't reverse this near a factory it's up to my yeah it's like you know i think it's yeah um but so the and as we so we're rapidly evolving i mean factory technology so um so anyway there's like basically having a a regular 25k model is pointless yeah it would be silly like it would be completely at odds with what we believe in in autonomous world what matters is the lowest cost per mile of efficiency of that vehicle and that's what we've done with yeah with the rope taxi exactly autonomous it's fully considered cost per mile um is what matters and if you try to make a car that is um you know essentially a hybrid manual automatic car it's it's not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car so yeah cyber cab is just not going to have steering wheels and pedals it's probably designed optimized for autonomy but no it it'll it'll you know cost on the order of cost roughly 25k so it is a 25k car and you can you will be able to buy one on an exclusive if you want um so just one have steering wheel comes you don't need it great thank you very much um the next question is what is tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centers so we aim on solving problems at the source so at the factory before they can even affect our customers we believe the best service is no service and yeah it really is don't even have them if the doesn't break yeah exactly that's the best thing don't see anyone with the tesla shirt you either do it fix the issue upstream or you would remotely do it through software they could be at work or at home you know car can be parked and we address fixed issue and we've partnered the field with service to make sure we're looking at the same issues and additionally just in q3 and q4 this year alone we we have opened and will open in total at nearly 70 locations and in north america we've significantly expanded the size of each location and have doubled and expanded the size of and have doubled the size last year compared to this year yeah i think i think it's like actually a lot of merits of having a large service centers because you can you can have specialization of labor because you can start your approach yeah it should be more factory-like um you know where you can have dedicated lanes for particular types of service and it's way easier for somebody to become expert in a few different types of repairs than in every repair exactly this has helped us with the base instead of these heavy repairs and the other things that we've done is we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past and we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past and we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past and we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past and we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past and we've been able to do a lot of things that we've done in the past like clogging up the lane they've dedicated lanes for different types of repairs and so it's through that matters and really treating it like a factory just yeah this is this is where it tells the structure i think the tesla has a strong advantage relative to the rest of the auto industry um because we make the cars and we service the cars whereas i think there's a bit of a conflict of interest with the dealer model and the the sort of traditional oem a dealer model where the dealerships make most of their money on service um and so they don't they obviously that's incented to reduce the servicing cost whereas in our case we are incented to reduce the service and cost because we we carry that service and cost and we've got a good feedback loop with our with our cars yeah with the factory with the service leaders together and send back people from the factories that field and feel to the factory to see it firsthand exactly suggestions for you know manufacturing as well as friends engineering on design yeah so i view this as a structural fundamental structural advantage of tesla versus the rest of the auto industry i also do a bunch of work on the software side not only to automate you know diagnostics um so identifying you know what needs to be done to a car before it comes into service but also automating all the preparation work and aligning all the resources that are necessary in order for the car to be very efficiently worked on once it arrives so the parts are there like the lift is all the technicians schedule like everything like a car what's wrong with me and tells the film the service center the car everything ready in advance yeah please fix me and this is what's wrong yeah this is what you're recommending now this is what i'm recommending yeah instead of customer trying to translate the car is telling us directly and we're pulling that yeah yeah you don't need most time you don't need to diagnose the car exactly when it arrives the car yeah this is like again a fundamental technology advantage and structural advantage compared to the rest of the auto industry yeah i think uh it's yeah i think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do yeah and that's why because like you said before most of our cars except for cyber drug look the same yeah right so people don't realize that it has so much capability yeah yeah yeah they look better than other cars but they but they're not like obviously like super futuristic yeah great thank you very much uh the next question is uh please provide an update on the semi uh what will the next stage of growth look like and when will fsd be ready sure so as you we posted an earnings back we're progressing swiftly on the build of the semi factory in there in our data factory in reno we've released all our major capital expenditures for that program and we're on track to start uh pilot builds in the second half of next year with production starting the first half of 2026 and ramping really throughout the year to full production um so my you know growth will largely depend on our customers and adoption of the product uh well i i don't think we're going to be demand limited honestly yeah which is what i was going to say which is like a brainer for the semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of ownership yes exactly it's it's good uh we have a kind of ridiculous demand for the semi um in that world where it's about how much do i spend to make exactly per mile it's a no-brainer yeah fundamentally if you've got a semi where the fully considered cost per mile for a ton of transport uh is better than a diesel truck uh any company that doesn't adopt an electric semi will lose it's not a it's not a subjective thing it's like of whether do you like this competitive i mean we like we we want the style we want we want to have a beautiful semi truck but frankly if we made an ugly semi truck um and this is proving so in our fleets and in pepsi's partner um in fact the pepsi actually said last week they're having nobody want their drivers don't want to go back once yeah yeah as soon as we have our drivers turn around you know you've got to turn around the small truck the electric semi it it's it's like the th that that's like the choice it's the what they want to drive yeah yeah yeah that's like like so they're like they're more senior like their top drivers will they get to drive the tesla semi and so it's uh it's it's the it's the thing they want to drive it's it's it's super fun to drive it's also very easy to drive it's easy it's easy to drive and it holds ass it's like fast yeah super fast maybe too fast well but i mean like you like you know like these like Or like a Tesla electric semi can go uphill speeding past the diesel truck. Or even cars. Yeah, even cars. So it's responsive. You floor it and the truck actually moves. And that's a benefit not only for the driver and for the goods, but also for safety in terms of other drivers on the road. You don't get stuck behind a semi. You're not in a slowdown situation in the on-road. And how that plays into FSD, which is the second part of the question. All of the semis have been, since the couple hundred we've deployed already, and the ones that we'll be building next year and throughout the future, have all of the hardware and the cameras necessary to deploy FSD. And we're currently training with that small fleet that we have. And as soon as the fleet is trained and the neural nets are up, we'll get FSD onto that platform. Yeah, I mean, it'll be a massive improvement in driver fatigue. Because it's... Driver safety. We've got sort of the anti-jackknifing software. You don't have to worry about your brakes overheating if you go down a steep hill. Because we use regenerative... That energy goes back into the pack. Actually, when we leave Reno... It's just like... It's radically better than a diesel semi. It's why the drivers love it. Great, guys. Thank you very much. Our next question is, when will Tesla incorporate X and Grok in all the Tesla vehicles? Well, I mean, these are relatively small fry things, you know. But yeah, I think we'll keep expanding, you know, what is available in the car on the screen. And also improving, like, the browser. So, like, just generally, you can access anything you want in the car. In fact, for the Tesla, you know, once you get to full autonomy, you actually want... Fully a... A system that is... Can do anything. Like, if you want to browse the internet. If you want to... You know, ask AI questions. If you want to watch a movie. If you want to play a video game. If you want to do some productivity thing. You can do anything you want in an autonomous vehicle. Because you don't need to drive. So, that's why the CyberCab's got a nice big screen. And a great sound system. So, you can watch a... Watch a great movie with... It's like being in a... Personal movie theater. Yeah, a personal movie theater. So, yeah. This is why we've been building this functionality. Adding gaming to the car. Adding MVs and other... You know, all sorts of different media applications to the car. Because, you know... The cars... That's what you're going to... Yeah, the cars will be built today. There's some really fun games, by the way. People haven't tried it. There's, like, Castle Doonbad and Palletopia. And a bunch of really fun games in the car. Yeah. We're constantly looking at, you know, what features. Just to add next. And we're paying attention to what's most commonly requested by our customers. Yeah. Play Castle Doonbad. You won't regret it. Great. Thank you guys very much. The next question is... Elon mentioned unsupervised FSD in California and Texas next year. Does that mean regulators have agreed to it in the entire state for existing hardware 3 and 4 vehicles? No. As I said earlier... California loves regulation. But they have a pathway. Yeah. I mean, there's a pathway. Obviously, Waymo operates in California. So, there's just a lot of forms to fill out and a lot of approvals that are required. I mean, I'd be shocked if we don't get approved next year. But it's just not something we totally control. But I think we will get approval next year in California and Texas. And towards the end of the year, it will branch out beyond California and Texas. I mean, I think it's important to reiterate this. Like, homologating or certifying a vehicle at the federal level in the U.S. is done by meeting FMVSS regulations. All our vehicles today... Like, our produced... Our autonomous vehicle will meet all those regulations. The cybercat will meet those regulations. And so, the deployment of the vehicle to the road is not a limitation. What is a limitation is what you said at the state level where they control autonomous vehicle deployment. Some states are relatively easy, as you mentioned, for Texas. Yeah. And other ones have had a place like California that may take a little longer. Other ones haven't set up anything yet. And so, we will work through those state by state. I do think we should have a federal... I agree. Like, autonomous vehicles should be approved. It should be possible to... Congress, if you're listening. Yeah. Let's get a federal AV... There should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. I mean, that's how FMVSS... Started and worked. Federal motor vehicle. FMVSS is federal. Yeah. So, I mean, in 2017 and 18, that's when regulators started looking at it. And it's really kind of stalled since then. But we would appreciate and would support helping out with those regulations. It really needs to be... Like, a national approval is important. You know, if there's a department of government efficiency, I'll try to help make that happen. And for everyone, not just Tesla, obviously. But, you know, just like some things in the U.S. are state by state regulated, like, for example, insurance. And it's like, it's incredibly painful to do it state by state for 50 states. And I think we should have... There should be a national approval process for autonomy. Great. Thanks, guys. The next question is, what is the plan for 2025? I think we just talked. I mean, basically, we talked about this. There's a lot going on. Elon already mentioned that we're working on cheaper models to come out. I mean, there's work which the team is doing to get the factories ready today to try and make that happen. Yeah. By the way, the amount of work required to make a lower cost car is insanely high. But, like, it is harder to get, like, 20% of the cost out of a car than it is to design the car. And build the entire factory in the first place. It's, like, excruciating. And there's not a lot of movies made about the heroes who got 20% of the cost out of a car. But let me tell you, there should be. That is incredibly heroic. It's the little changes. It's not like a silver bullet. Yeah. It's like, there should be the heroes who got 20% of the cost out of a car. It's like, damn, I want to respect them. It's like a movie. It's like... You know, I think you probably could make a compelling movie. But it just... Like, if you actually saw how hard it was to do that, you'd be like, whoa, that's damn hard. Just yesterday, we were talking about potting. Yeah. I mean, honestly, like, literally, yeah. I mean, there's a lot of... What I do call it sort of like getting cost out of things. It's kind of like... It's like Game of Pennies. It's like Game of Thrones, but pennies. You know, first approximation, if you've got 10,000 items... In a car. Very rough approximation. And each of them costs $4. Then you have a $40,000 car. So, if you want to make a, you know, a $35,000 car, you've got to get 50 cents on average out of the 10,000 items. Every time. Every part. Yeah. And it's like... And then, obviously, the best is you delete some parts. In fact, we found we were able to delete a lot of parts. I'm very excited about the cybercap design. The design. And the... You know, how we're rethinking the design of a car for the cybercap. Designing a full-auto high-volume production. And then designing a machine that builds the machine. That I think is also revolutionary. And it's just... There's no other car company that's even trying to do what we're doing. Like, I've never even heard of it, actually. In fact, I'm certain there is someone. Like... Like, I think this... On your... Machine that builds the machine. Like, it's... It's inherent. Like, it's... It's designed to be, like... You know... Five times better than a traditional factory. Like, cycle time. Cycle time and, like, parts deletion. I don't think any other car company has the same level of, like, integration of thought that we have. When it comes to, like... When you design a part from a white sheet of paper. Who's going to make it? Where is it going to be made? How is it going to be shipped? How is it going to be assembled into the vehicle? And, like... At any one point, if something is done in a silo, it becomes a bottleneck of either cost or time or efficiency. But with the... With the... Robotaxi, you know, the development. Like, we've done a good job on combining all that. And then, like, blowing up how it's made and saying it should be made this way. And rethinking it all so it's the most efficient factory possible. That shows in our... It will show in our CapEx efficiency when we deploy it. It shows in our... It shows in our... It shows in our... It shows in the simplicity of the vehicle. But also how it performs in terms of, like, end-user state. Yeah. Just to close out. Just on the energy front also in 25. We will have started manufacturing at the mega factory Shanghai. We'll continue to increase our storage deployments with Powerwall 3. We plan to continue expanding our supercharging network. Getting more OEMs on our network. 4680 in that cell ramp, as Elon talked about. That will keep going. And then we also will have our lithium refinery starting to produce. So there's a lot which is going on. Great. Yeah. So many things. Yeah. I mean, the crazy thing is, like, Tesla is winning basically on almost every single thing we're doing. If we're not winning now, we're on 5-1. In an arena where there are entire large companies, that's the only thing they do. Yeah. I mean, it's a company. There are multiple companies within the company. Yeah. Tesla is like many companies within one. Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Just a few more. What is going on with the Tesla Roadster? Fun things. Well, I'd just like to thank our long-suffering deposit holders of the Tesla Roadster. The reason it hasn't come out yet is because the Roadster is not just the icing on the cake. It's the cherry on the icing on the cake. And so, you know, our larger mission is to accelerate. We're going to accelerate the progress towards a sustainable energy future. You know, try to do things that maximize the probability that the future is good for humanity and for Earth. And so that necessarily means that, like, the things like that are kind of like dessert. We'd all love to work on the Tesla Roadster. It is super fun. And we are working on it. But it has to come behind the more things that have a more serious impact on the good. And that's the point of the world. So just thank you to all our long-suffering Tesla Roadster deposit holders. And we are actually finally making progress on that. And we're close to finalizing the design on that. It's really going to be something spectacular. You know, a friend of mine, Peter Thiel. You know, sometimes people think of Peter Thiel. You know, we're rivals. We're really good friends, to be clear. You know, Peter, you know, was lamenting how, you know, the future doesn't have flying cars. Well, we'll see. More to come. Yeah. Great. Thank you very much. The next one is quite similar to other questions we've had. So I might combine it with the final question. So briefly, could you just detail how Robotexy will roll out? Will it start with a Tesla-deployed fleet? And then allow customers to get on board? And then allow customers to get on board? And then allow customers to get on board? And then allow customers to get on board? And then allow customers to get on board? To add theirs on, like, a subscription model? And then will hardware 3 be capable of level 5 at this point? As you're going to hardware 3, what we saw with 12.5 was it was easier to make rapid progress with starting with hardware 4 and figuring out the solution and then backporting it to hardware 3 instead of directly working on hardware 3, given that hardware 4 has more, like, fundamental hardware capabilities. I think that trend will continue into the next few. corners as well but we first figured the solution rapidly with ai4 and then backported right the kernels it just takes longer to narrow those things because it's not fundamentally supported in the hardware and it's emulated um but yeah it's initially working on hardware for backporting it to hardware 3. yeah so it's exactly we're not we're not 100 sure um but um but but our as a short question um because uh by some measures hardware 4 has has really as several times the capability of hardware 3 it's easier to get things to work with hardware 4 um and then uh it takes a lot of effort to sort of squeeze that functionality into hardware 3. um and uh you know there is some chance that hardware 3 is does not achieve the safety level that um allows for unsupervised fsd uh you know there's there's some chance of that um and and if if that turns out to be the case uh we will upgrade those who have bought hardware 3 fsd for free um and we have designed the system to be um upgradable you know so uh and it's really it's really what you know just to switch it sort of switch out the computer type of thing um like the camera the cameras are okay you know they're capable but um anyway we don't we don't actually know the answers to that but if it does turn out um we will take we'll make sure we take care of those who have bought fsd on hardware 3. great and the last few minutes that we have left we will try to get in some analyst questions uh the first question will be coming from pierre farragut at new street and pierre please feel free to unmute yourself thanks a lot guys for taking my question um i was wondering about like um the composite yours savings general episode and non dwell format perspective um in terms of blues let's say compare like 2.6sg back and forth一些 you know for example you know with Lag moi gambiaEO and that is an ilipec right on all screens in and facebook server to into Stock Exchange using however the version of that one on your mobile would be to keep in mind if you don't regret entering the code it could break some of the lag each time you do so that's a question i guess it's something you should not be really worried about because like that's especially when it sometimes while you know i will make settings that data is not will learn once an arm is accurate it will change larger the way open AI go from GPT-3 to GPT-4, or is that more like you're set on your model and you need to throw more and more compute to accelerate the pace of learning to improve reliability? And then I had a quick follow up real quick on your rollout in Texas and in California next year. The plan as you see today, is it to roll out like a fleet or two with cars that will start with like a supervisory, like some onboard supervision, someone sitting at the wheel just in case and removing the supervisors progressively, or are you aiming for going fully fledged without even a human supervisor when you get started? Okay, well, I guess we're going to answer, yeah, the first part of the question, and then the other thing before that, I'll make it into a next talk, but basically in terms of it being a counter dentalcape Sn hätten of what to counts to grant $20 million half a year from snapped364 plus Item V支配, or, like I said in the beginning, $20 million of Можетaproex contentFORE. And of course it's coming back, there's more work out there, terms of allowing within LMS. You know, obviously for EpicSA, it would be the same. If it were for light, the more it actually actions would be different than in the state that has a lot of data. But in addition, very broadly the hoje not worth emailing or trying to you know, understand data copy to the company data, into a small number of control outputs. Whereas it's like, you don't really, it's very rare to have, in fact, I'm not sure any LLM out there can do gigabytes of context. And then you've got to then process that in the car with a very small amount of compute power. So, it's all doable and it's happening, but it is a different problem than what say a Gemini or an OpenAI is doing. And now, part of the way you can make up for the fact that the inference computer is quite small is by spending a lot of effort on training. And just like a human, the more you train on something, the less mental workload it takes when you do it. Like when the first time a human starts driving, it absorbs your whole mind. But then as you train more and more on driving, you get very good, then the driving becomes a background task. It only absorbs a small amount of your mental capacity, because you're not doing it. You're not even trying to get a sense of it, and really my 사진 is out there. It takes a lot of passion and a lot of effort to assemble it into the right bipartisan media because you have a lot of training. So, we can make up for the fact that the inference computers, it's tiny compared to a 10-kilowatt bank of GPUs, because you've got a few hundred watts of inference compute. We can make up for that with heavy training. of data coming in are tremendous. And then sorting out what training is important, you know, of the vast amounts of video training, or video data coming in complete, what is actually most important for training? That's also quite difficult. But as I said, we're not currently training compute construct. I'm sure if you wanna elaborate on that. Yeah, like you mentioned, the training has both trained large models, also trained quicker, but in the end, we still gotta pick which models are performing better. So the validation effort to picking the models, because the miles per intervention is pretty large, we have to drive a lot of miles to go in close to. We do have simulation and other ways to get those metrics, those two help, but in the end, that's a big bottleneck. Yeah, that's why we're not training compute construct and following the UX, and getting really good at what he says about, or the data that we have, which is an important concept along and that not everyone skill enough to figure that out. That's the big problem for us. Yeah, sure. obviously when we're ready and safety is there, we'll remove all the traction from the ride share current. Yeah, I mean, I guess like we think that we'll be able to have driverless Teslas doing paid rides next year, sometime next year. All right, thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. Adam, please feel free to unmute yourself. Okay, thanks, everybody. Just had a question about the relationship between Tesla and XAI. Many investors are still not clear how the work at XAI is truly beneficial to Tesla. Some even take the view that the two companies may even be in competition with each other in terms of talent and tech, and even your time, Elon. So what's your message to investors on that relationship between Tesla and XAI? And where do you see it going over time? Thanks. Well, I should say that XAI has been helpful to Tesla AI quite a few times in terms of things like scaling up, like training. Just even like recently in the last week or so, improvements in all-tolerant training, where if you're doing a big training run and a node fails, being able to continue training and getting a good training run is pretty good. And easy to recover from on a training run, XAI has been pretty helpful. But there are different problems. XAI is working on artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence. Tesla is trying to make autonomous cars and autonomous robots. They're different problems. So, it's not just a matter of how you make it, but it's also a matter of how you make it. And that's why I think XAI is a very good tool for the field. And I think it's been very helpful in terms of the way that you're doing it, and the way that you're doing it. I think we've said this before also, like not all AI is equal, right? I mean, AI is a broad spectrum. Yeah. And we have our own swim lanes. Yes, there are certain things which we can collaborate on if needed, but for the most part, we're solving different issues. Yeah. Tesla is focused on real-world AI. I was saying earlier, it is quite a bit different from conventional drukata. There are many different types of AI. I think I just agree with you. It's very necessary, and if Kubrick offensively promised you a better job on the environment of heavy casual explanation, it makes it much worse when you ... if you are doing it with a normal low-command, and thatHHHH ? Good question, it's very interesting. ... Why you did that? Yeah, person assistance, in terms of what some vehicles do too. 10 kilowatts of GPUs in a car. We've got a couple hundred watts and it's a pretty well-designed Tesla AI chip, but it's still a couple hundred watts. But there are different problems. I mean, it's like the stuff that XAI does, like when it's running inference, I mean, it is running inference, like answering questions, answering test questions on a 10-kilowatt rack. It's like, you can't put that in a car. It's a different problem. Please no. No, exactly. So, XAI is because I felt there wasn't a truth-seeking digital superintelligence company out there. Like, that's what it came down to. They needed to be a truth-seeking like an AI company that is just very rigorous about being truthful. And so, I'm not saying XAI is perfect, but that is at least the explicit aspiration. Even if something is, you know, politically incorrect, it should still be truthful. I think this is very important for AI safety. So, anyway, I think XAI has been helpful to Tesla and will continue to be helpful. Tesla, but there are very different problems. Great. You know, and I mean, like, if you're like, like, what is, like, what other car company has, it has a world-class chip design team? Like, zero. What other car company has a world-class AI team like Tesla does? Zero. Those are all startups. They're created from scratch. Great. Thank you, Milan. And I think that's, unfortunately, all the time that we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions, and we look forward to hearing from you next quarter. Thank you very much, and goodbye.\""
