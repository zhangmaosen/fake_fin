       "  'text': \" So and oh, mm mm at point point. So we have seven um i you're fun of going. I is buying it for you for is is is just by the time. Yeah, student, yeah and and toiling, good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to tesla's. Third quarter twenty twenty four q and a webcast by my name is travis maxoron head investor relations, and i'm enjoyed today by emon busk the bob tesia and a number of other executives. Our q three results were announced at about three pm central time in the update deck we published at the same link as his webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today, actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings of the sec, join the question and answer portion of today's call. Please limit yourself to one question. And what follow up, please use the raise hand button to join the question queue before we jump into q and a you want has some opening remarks. Elon, ah thank you. So to recap, as someone listening um is something something that what a want of industry of seeing europe over your declines and order volumes in q three tends at the same time as achieved record deliveries. In fact, i think if you look at EV companies worldwide to the best line knowledge, no eb company is even profitable. And and i'm not to the best, my knowledge, there is no EB division of any company of any existing or company company that profprofitable. So it is notable that tells that is profitable, despite a very challenging, what a lot of environment, abby and and and this quarter actually is record q three for us. And so we produced our seventh million vehicle actually just yesterday. So congratulations to the teams that made it happen in tesla. That's the staggeringly immense amount work to make seven million cars um so the see, and we also also have the energy storage business is um growing like wildfire with strong demand for both bank bank and towel um and as we will know, on october tenth, we laid out a vision for an autonomous and look for future than i think, is very compelling. Uh myself with, you know, the the test team did AA normal job there with, um it actually giving people an opportunity to experience the future where where you have human nod robots walking among the crowd, not not you know, a canned video presentation or anything, but literally walking among the crowd. So he drinks whatnot and um and we had fifty autonomous vehicles. There were go twenty cyber caps, but there were an additional thirty moral wise operating fully autonomously the entire night, carrying thousands thousands of peoples thousands of people shaate um was, there was no incidence, the entire night time. So and and well, those went there that i it's it's worth emphasizing that these the sibercap had no steering wheel or break or accelerated petals. I think there was though there's no past, though there was no way for and they want to intervene manually even if they wanted to. And the whole night, march, very smoothly. So um regarto, the vehicle business, we are still on track to deliver more affordable models siding in the first half of twenty twenty five. I have, you know, the the buses, i think probably probably werweren't. What should they assume me vehicle favehicle sales growth next year? And and at at the risk of to taking a better risk here, i do want to give some some rough estimate, which is i think it's twenty to thirty percent vehicle growth next year. Um you know, notwithstanding negative external events, like if there's some portion of your events, some big wool breaks out or interest rates go skyhigh or something like that. Then you know, we greek, we can't overcome mass enforcement, sure events, but II think with other class vehicles with the event autonomy, something like a twenty to thirty percent growth next year is is ah my best case, um and god. And then and then sava cap reaching volume production in twenty six. You do feel confident of a facour camp reaching buying production, twenty six surches starting production with reaching buying production at twenty six. And that i don't here that that that should be substantial. Both. We were angry a for there at least two million units. A year of of cybercamp that they'll be in more than one factory, but i think it's at least two million dollars years year, maybe four money. Ultimately, i'm so bye. Yeah, these are just my best guesses. But if ask ask more our best guests guests that the docts from my best guests, a beit, the twenty six, the the the cell twenty six eighty lines, the team is actually during great work there. The porter, six eighty is ah rapidly approaching the point where it is the most competitive cell. So when you consider the the fully get the fully landed, the the cost of ah of a battery bank, um fully landed in the US net of incentives and duties of e. Three, forty, six eighty is tracking to be the most competitive really being lower cospmic. And what are fully concerned than any other little senator, which is i'm not quite there yet, but we're we're close to being there, which i think is extremely exciting. And we've got several and a lot of ideas to go well beyond that. So if like, i think there's if we execute well of forty six eighty, we'll have the the tesa internally produced cell will be the cocost competitive sell of and and tovenin's america, um a testament to tremenous amount of hard work there from the tank. So um that's say, rule will continue to buy a lot of cells from our competitors, our tents not to make to to provided to to make cells just internally. So i don't want to set off any of law bells here. We we're asked increasincreasing substantially our bigger output and our stationary storage output. So we need a lot of cells, and most of them will still come from suppliers. But ah, but i think it is alzander some good news that the tesla and tuncell cell is likely is strineeds needs to be the most competitive than ten ys. So with respect to autonomy, as people are, are experiencing in the cars really from week to week, there are significant improvements in the the miles between interventions. And so with the delosion twelve point five release of full stuff, driving and sour truck. The and it doesn't combining the code into a single stack so that the city driving and the antna highway driving are or one stack, which is a big, bigger vement for the highway driving. So it's it's it's just all neural nets, broound. And the release of actually smart summon, we try to have a sense of humor herattest um and and we're also uh so that that's one point five, uh version, thirteen of FSD. Uh, what is going on soon, have a show will elaborate run at to better and home. Um we we expect to see so roughly a five or six world improvement in miles between interventions compared to twelve point five um and actually looking at the the year's whole of the improvement in miles between interventions. We think we'll bring at least three hours of magnitude. So it's done. That's that's a very dramatic improvement and in the course of the year. And i expect that print continue you next year. So um the the current, the current in total expectation, the upsazing general expectation award the cheser m sd, having if um logger miles between the international family human is the second quarter of next year. Hello, which means it may up being the third quarter, but it's it's next. It's it seems extremely likely to be next year. Sure. Do you want to very much? Yeah, i'm tioning miles between technical interventions. Um yeah, like you mentioned alone, we already made a hundred x uh improvement with twelve or five from running up this year. And then with v thirteen release, we expect to be uh a thousand x from the beginning from january this year on my production greese software, um and this came in because of technology improvements going to end end uh having higher frame rate. Uh, partly also helped by hardware force, uh more capabilities um so on and vy hope that we continue to scale the new network, the data, the training compute, et cetera by q two next year. We should cross over the uh average human minds for critical intervention public collision. In the case. I mean that that is just um unbonished our total estimate, yes. Yeah, so so that that's not sandbagging or anything else. Um um journalestimate is q two next year of tweet are save than newman. And then to continue with rapid improvements thereafter, huh, chuck comes went with to to alkaloi that that it um and vast majority of humanity has no idea that couors provide themselves. I means so actually for something like eca model, three or model line. It looks like AA car, so you don't expect molohigh to be able to the intelligence enough stridrive itself. The set of caablets looks different. Different, seven chocoldifferent different, but water tal wine, model, three air. Look, there are good looking cards, but look at ethic, but bafairly normal, if you don't expect a belly on oil looking car to have the intelligence, they have enough AA to be able to drive self, but it does. So we we do want to expose that to more people. And and so we're we're we're doing with every time. We have um a significant improvement in the software will multiple roll out another sort of day to day trial. So to encourage people to try to gain and and we're all seeing a significant improvement in adoption. Oh, so the the take of take grade for msc is ah improved substantially, especially after the ten ten event and yeah. So so there's there's no need to wait for robert taxi stama camp ford to experience full autonomy. We expect to achieve that next year with the with our existing vehicle line. Um what it's it's actually smart. Someone gives a small taste of what it's going to look like the car able to drive itself to the user within private parking routes. Currently it's speed limited, but then it's going a quickly be increase. And we already add more than a billion uvitch himself himself a stterman. Yep, so ali, and we actually we have four telesla the employees in the bay area. We already are are offering a right healing capability. So so you can actually use with with the development app. You can request a riot, and it'll take you anywhere in the bay area. We we do have a safety driver for now, but the software required to do that. We've we've developed developed and great david. You want to elaborate on it. Yeah, sure. David. Um we showed some screenshots of this in the key one ah shareholder deck. And um yeah, this is real. We've been testing it for the part of the year and the the building blocks that we needed in order to build this functionality and deliver it in production. We've been thinking about looking on for years. Um it just so happens that we've used those building blocks to deliver great features for our customers in the meantime, such as sharing your profile, synchronizing it across cars, so that every single car that you jump into, whether it's you know, another car that you own or a car that somebody's loan to you or a rental car that you jump into. It looks exactly like yours, everything synchronized seat, mirror positions. You know, media navigation, everything is the same just what you would expect from one of our robo taxis, um, but you know, we gave the functionality to our customers right now because we built it intending for it to be used in the future. Releasing that functionality. Now all the and then cybersecurity that we knew we're going to need to deliver that functionality um sending a navigation to destination from your phone to the vehicle. And so you know, you're doing that now with the the right hailing app, but it's something that we've made available to customers for years, seen the progress on a route in the mobile app. That's something you'll need for the right healing app. But again, we released it in meantime. So it's not like we're just starting to think about this stuff right now. While we're building out, you know, the early stages of our right healiling network, we've been thinking about this required a long time. And we're excited to get the function out out there. Yeah. And and we do expect to roll out um ride hailing in california, texas next year to public, um not the california is somewhere. There's quite a long regulatory approval process. I attention. I think we should get approval next year, but it, but it's contingent upon regulatory approval textexas um a lot faster. So it's so it can't say like we're um, but will definitely have available in texas and probably have it available. And in in california is subject to our regulatory agreement. And then and and maybe some of the states actually next year as well. But at least california, texas um so that 'd be be very exciting. That's really a profound change. Tesla becomes more than a sort of pickle end up. Yep, after we make backroom company um to that point. Okay. So um we publish that of q three vehicle safety report, which shows one in bad for every seven hundred miles of one pilot. That compares the US average water crash, roughly every seven hundred thousand miles. So it's currently showing attentanx safety improvement relative to the US average, and we continue to expand our ai training capacity to accommodate the needs of both fsd and optimists. We are currently not not training compute constraint. Ah it's a plug big, so many factors that the uh the the fsd is actually getting so good that it takes us a while to actually find mistanakes. And when you start getting to where it can take ten thousand miles to find out a mistake. It's a it takes a while to actually figure out which it is. Is this a bull? It's a software bot, band and a software, boat, ama and software boat b it. It actually takes a while figuring out because neither one of them making mistakes that what takes take a long time to make mistakes. So that's actually the single one that picks so many factories, how long does it take us to figure out which which which version is better, are we? So that's sort of high class problem um absolutely having a drying fleet um as it is very helpful for burkey, breaking the sound other with with optimist. We showed we showed of an massive improvement in optimist, dexterity movement on october tenth, and our next gen hand and poem, which has twenty two degrees freedom double, which double the the prior up um panderforum. It is extremely humor like, and we'll say us much better. I checked out sensing um it it. It really doesn't ah feel confident cing, and we have most advanced human rights robot by longshot, right. And the moreover, but the only company that really has all of the ingredients necessary to scale of q red robots. Haven't because the the the things that that one, one of the companies is missing is that they're missing the ai brain and they're missing and the ability to really scale to very high volume production. And so so you sometimes see some impressive ssive video demos, but what, but they they like, the that they like the localized ai and the voyato scale volume to very high numbers. Um as i've said on a few occasions before, i think optimists will ultimately be the philosoponical part ten. I think has good chance of being the most valuable productively uh for the energy business that's doing extremely well. And there's this the the offcharahead ahead is gating of the lathroo beggar pack factory. And reached two hundred megapacks a week, which is now a forty gigawatt gigawatt hour a year run rate. And we have a second factory in shanghai that will begin with the twenty gigawatt hour year run rate in q one next year. So just take next quarter and that that help people also scale off, it won't be long before we're shipping one hundred gigawatt out of the year, stationary storage at cetherland and enrol data telalogue alright, that, that will ultimately grow. I think to to multiple terawatt hours per year, it has to to in in to to AA ined way in the future. If you're not at the termot scale here, you're not really moving the needle. So um if if you look at our mentally very complicated, uh last master plane, which do i get just too much detail, i'll maybe i'll ask up to. I'm eliza shorting up up. Okay, give us the TLDR on collects most of plan, but we we show in that best plan that it is possible to take all of earth to a fully sustainable energy situation, using sustainable energy power generation and batteries and electric transport, um and there were no fundamental material limitations, like there's not some very rare material that we don't have an outlog on it with. We actually have enough of the raw materials to yeah dum, take all of human civilization, make it. And fully sustainable. And even if stmlization raaddly preesthots like just usage, who would slowly voice, st, st walke, you know, but one way to think of um the progress of a civilization space on a little esoteric, but is percentage completion of caua ship scale. So cautial scale one would be you're using all the power of a of a planet. We were were currently less than one percent on car ship level level, one double two would be using all the power of the sun and double three, all apart the galaxy. So AA long way to go. And such a kind of bloom point cup, um when do you think of ttership terms, it becomes obvious that by that, the by far, the biggest source of of energy is the sun. Everybody else is i have and the noise, tom, um so a conclusion tells that it's focused on building the future of energy transport, robotics and ANI. And this is a time when others are just focused on managing around near term trends. We think what we're doing is thread approach. And if we execute on our objectives, and i think we will tells us my prediction is tzla will become the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long bylong shot. Um i want to thank the details of the team once again for strong execution in a tough operating environment. And we're looking forward to pulling um an incredibly exciting future. Thank you, great. Thank very much elon and that that bob has some old remarks as well. Yeah, thanks, our cue results were more all positive. And once again, demonstrate the skills which businesses evolved were the eus and the generation of record operating cash flows of six point three billion automotive revenues grew both quarter quarter and year year on year. While we we had unit volume growth, we did experience adduction in aspb, primarily due to the impact of financing incentives. As a reminder, we are providing these incentives, primarily using thirdparty banks and financial institution and recognize the cost of these incentives as enough front reduction to well, we released fsd for cybertruck and other features, like actually smart, someone like ga talked about about not miga. Each contributed three hundred and twenty six million of revenues. In the quarter, we continue to see elevated levels of regulatory credit sales with about two billion of revenues so far this year, expand on this at an industry level, china continues to outperform US and europe, i am factory of three. And if there is something to be learned from that, this gives a signal of what is to come in other regions as customers, acceptance of evv girls. And we feel that is the right strategy to build affordable and more comparing needs a focus remains on growing youth volume while avoiding a buildup of inventory to support this strategy while continuing to offer extremely compelling vehicle financing options in everyone. When you compare any vehicle in a lineup with other oems, believe our vehicles provide much better value, particularly when you consider the safety features of formats and unpanel software functionalities, like david also talked about include also what shook had talked about other autonomy music options, parental controls and much more. While every vehicle in our liner comes up with these capabilities, there is an awareness cap not just with buyers, but at times, even with existing holders, we plan on making these more visible in our interactions with both existing and future customers. Automotive margins improved quarter over quarter as a result of fifty feature release discussed before increase in our overall production and delivery. Warding ing continued benefit from market marketing prising and more localized deliveries in region, which resulted in lower freight and duties. Sustaining these margins in k four power will be challenging given the current economic and one so that we are focused on the cost per vehicle, and there are numerous work streams within the company to squeeze our cost without compromising on customer experience. Yeah, and something that that's a helpful. Hopefully, helpful macro trend is, if there's a decline in in interest rates, this has mass work backed on dvm on what might it meant the best vast majority of people is the the demand is driven by the month payment connect with the multiple payment. So make more life, and we'll see continue decline, interest rates, which helps with affordability vehicles. Yeah, i mean, that is one term, which we absorserved in the industry of that. You know, because of affordability being impacted because of interests. People are warding one to the car so longer, especially in the US. And that is actually having an impact on role of industry team. Have we discussed all year as we discussed by orders energy deployments fluctuate quarter over quarter due to cosualitiness location of orders being fulfilled and not necessarily an indicator of demand or production within the quarter. While we did see a decline in 3qwe expect to grow diloomyment sequentially in qfour to end the year, but more than double the of last year, energy margins in q three for a record of four than thirty percent. This is a function of mix of projects being deployed in the quarter note that there will be fluctuation in margins as we manage through deployments and our inventory, our pipeline and backlog continued to grow quarter or quarter as we fill our twenty twenty five production slots, and we are doing our little best to keep for with the demand just coming back on automotive margins. Uh, i talked about two sides. I talked about to what is happening, one other thing, which i want to also share is that wish that you know we will continue to keep whatever we can to squeeze, like i said before about squeezing off the cost. But this is something which we also are very capable of. I mean, just in q three, we will reach our lowest cost per weight go. And that is a turn which we want to keep focus off, then going on to service another. We continue to show influence in q three. This was a result of better performance, both in our service business, which includes collision, part sales and merchandise, and continued growth is super charging. His feedbased revenues will continue to grow as overall fleet size increases. Our operating expenses declined quarterwork quarter and a year on year lesson. This is partially due to the restructuring we undertook in 2 cost saving from these initiatives were partially offset by increase in costs related to earlier efforts. We've started using the gpu cluster based out of our factory house ahead ahead of schedule and on track to get fifty k. Gps deployed in texas by the end of this month. One thing, which i'd like to elaborate is that we're being ready judicious on our ai compute spend too, and saying how best we can utilize the existing infrastructure before making further investments on the capex front. We had over three and a half building in the quarter. This was a sequential increase, largely because of investments at ai compute. We not expect the capex for the year to be in excess of eleven billion. We shared our vision for the future at the real robot event. At the beginning of the month, the tesla team is hyper focus on delivering on that version. Now all efforts are underway to make it a reality. While we've achieved significant progress this year, it will take time to get this as we pioneered new and incredibly complex technologies and navigate a fragmental regulatory landscape. Future is incredibly bright. And i want to thank that. That's letting once again on all the heart. Great. Thank you very much keb. And now we'll go to investor questions. The first one is is tesla still on track to deliver the more affordable model next year as mentioned by elon earlier. And how does it align with your ai product right now? Sure. I mean, as elan and bible, both said, you are in plan to meet the the first half of next year, our mission has always been to lower the cost of of the of our vehicles to increase adoption of sustainable energy and transport. Um part of that is is lowering the osburg current fables, which is where all of the personally own vehicles that we sell today come in. But the next stage in that really is, it fits into ai romamap is when we bring in roma taxis, which lowers the initial cost of of getting into an eb. And those that's really where we see the marriage of of ev roroad map in the ai of it. Yeah, maybe it'll be like wood width with instead of sub. So thirty k bar villages canna key threshold great. Thank very much. Uh similar question next. When can we expect tesla to give us the twenty five thousand dollar non robot taxi regular car model? We're we're we're not making it on. Yeah, all our vehicles today are road ads. I think we think very clear that uh we're we're like the future is autonomous um it. I mean, i don't it's gonna be. They are a nice actually said this some many years ago, but that in in my strong belief, and i believe that is panty ought to be true, starting it and and be very obvious. Retrospect is that the future is of autonomous eletry vehicles. Ps nonautonomous gasoline vehicles in here, which will be like riding a horse or using a flip bone. Um it's not that there are no voices. Yeah. There are some hostels, but they're unusual their niche um and i you know, so so religious everything's gonna be electrical autonomous help me. I think this, this is blind, like it should be, frankly, blindingly obvious at this point that that is the future. Um so a lot of autommotor companies, most most of modern companies have not not internalize this, which is surprising because we're with chat shouting this from the rooftops for such a long time um and it will accruit to their triments in the future. Um but all all of our vehicles in the future, we autonomous even to that fair. Yes, all of vehicvehicles that we've really really made other seven million vehicles. The vast majority are capable of autonomy. And um you know, we're currently making it on the order of thirty by a thousand autonomous vehicles a week peure pet to to say way, most entire fleet just less than they've, they've listened a out of corners, perfect twenty five a week. Yeah, and our cars look novel. Yeah, they mostly did a normal the cyber truck looks. Yes. Thankfully, you know, looks some abnoble um and then the side, you know, cyber cab slash probotaxi. Yeah, we we wanted to have something futuristic about. And i think think that's like futuristic um and it's it's worth the ing with respect to the cybercat. It's not, but it's especially not just a revolutionary vehicle design, but a revolution in vehicle manufacturing that is also coming with this. What the cyber cab. I'll be the cycle times like the um the you do sper brow of of the cyber cab line. It is like this is just really something special. I mean, this is maybe you've yeah half ordered mags you entered in other car manufacturing lines, like like you like, oh, like nine ninety in the same week is what i'm saying. And on the same week um so so it's it's it's you know that and II said, thank you. Okay. So you're still at the maybe the most one of the hottest has like part. Copy will be, you know, just like biofactory um in camera verses neafacfactory. It's after two months. Yeah, it's like in africans that um the so the and and as we so we're and we're rapidly evolving and manufacturing technology. So yeah, it's anyway that there's like face II, think having an enterof a irregular, twenty five k models pointless. Yeah, it would be silly like we can be eight at us with what we believe in in our town as well, but matters as well as cost per mile of of yet of efficiency of that vehicle. And that's what we've done with yeah. But the rock taxi exactly at thomas, it's it's fully considered cost per mile um is what matters. And if you try to make part of that is yeah essentially a hybrid manual automatic carit's. It's not going to be as good as a dedicated autonomous car time. Yes, our cap is is just not gonna have string wheels and pedas. Oh, you sign off my es for tony, and and it'll it'll it'll itknow cost on order order cost cost rouffly twenty five k. So it will, it is a twenty five k car, and you can, you will be able to buy one when it exclusive exclusively, if you want. And so just what have steromobile comes is stwebitterheated great. Thank you very much. The next question is, what is tesla doing to alleviate long wait times at service centers. So we we aimed on solving problems at the source. So at the factory before they couldn't even affect our customers. Ah, we believe the best service is no service. And yeah, really don't even have the if the quarters will break. Yeah, exactly, that's what's best there. Don't see any with the test show you either do the the fixed issue upstream or you would remotely do the software they be at work or at home. And you know, card be parked and we address fixed issue issue. And we've ed the field with service to make sure we're looking at the same issues and tionally tionally just in q three q four this year long. We we have open and will open in total at nearly seventy locations and in north america, we significantly expand the size of each location and have doubled the size last year compared to this year. Yeah, i think i think it was actually actually a lot of it to having ah large service centers because you can, you can have specialization of labor because you started, you can start to approach. Yeah, actually more factory like, um you know where you can have dedicated lanes, full particular types of service. And and it's way easier for somebody to come expt in a few different types of repairs than in every repair. Exactly this has helped us with the base of these heavy repairs like clogging up a lane, they've dedicated lanes for different type of repairs. And so it's through put matters and really treating it like a factory. Yeah, this is this is where tesla structure. I think ttenla has a stroncal advantage relative to the rest of the order industry, because we we make the cars and we service the cars, whereas the best bit of a a conflict of interestis will be the the dealer model and the ah the the sort of traditional oem, a dealer model where the dealer ships make most of their money on service. And so they they they don't have. They helps the diincencento reduce the servicing ing cost, whereas in our case, we are incented to reduce the service and cost because we we carry that servicing cost. And we've got a good feedback with with ccars exactly like we with the factory with the service leaders together and send send people from the factory of the field and feel from the factory to see it firsthand exactly by suggestions for manufacturing as well as for engineering on design. Yes, i view this as a structural fundamental structural advantage. Tesla versus the rest of the order, register person doing a bunch of work on the software side. Not only to you know, diagnostics, sorry, identiidentify, what needs to be done to a car. It comes comes service, but also automating all the preparation work and aligning all resources that are necessary in order for the card be very efficiently worked on once it arrives. So the parts are there like the lift is scheduled technician schedule, like everything that we like go far. So this, this, what's wrong me me tells us till the service or and carnage everything ready in advagain, please fix me. And this is what's wrong, is that that you i dy? Yeah, instead a customer trying to translate the cars telling us directly, and we're pulling that. Yeah, you don't need what's time. You don't need diagnose the car exactly when it arrives the car. This is like again, you got fun. Okay. Technology advantage and trufcal advantage compared to the rest of the order industry. It's yeah. I think it's underappreciated as to what all we are able to do. Yeah. And that's where because like i said before, most are four cars except for cyber drug look to say, yeah. So people don't realize that it has so much capability. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like not better than other cars, yeah, but but but that they are like like like like super futuristic. So yeah, okay, it's very much. The nice question is please provide an update on the semi at. What will the next stage of growth look like? And when will fsd be ready sure? So as you we posted an earning, we're progressing swifly on the build of the semi factory in there in our data factory in reno, we've released all our major cappo expenditures for that program, and we're on track to start pilot builds in the second second half next next year, with production, starting the first half of twenty twenty six and ramping really throughout the year to to full production. Um some of my you know, growth will largely depend on our customer's adoption of the product on it. Well, i don't think we're going to be diviate limited. Yeah, which i who say, which is like the total brain or for the semi because it's really a commodity of total cost of no reason. Yes, it's accurate. It's it's good. We live. It's kind of ridiculous about what the MI um in that little where it's about how much do i spend to meet to it that that seems per mile? It's taking a brainer. Yeah, yeah, fundamentally, if if you've got a semi where where the fully considered cost of per mile ah or for a ton of transport is better than say, diesel truck, any company that doesn't adopt if you have an electric semi will will lose. It's not ah it's ah it's not a subject of thing. It's like whether whether you like like this ent. I mean, we like we we want to start and want. We want to have a good old semi truck. But frankly, if you made an oquysei truck, what it matter um and and this is proving so in our fleets and in pepsi, a partner. In fact, the the pepsi actually said last week, there have nobody one their drivers don't want to go back. Yeah, yeah, this as as we give anyone at the electric semi. And it's it's like the the that that's like the choice. It's the what they're going to drive. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like like, so they're like they're more seen. Ah like they're they're top drivers. Will they get to drito to tell us someone. Yes, it's ah it's it's the it's the thing they want to dry. It's it's it's super fun dry. It's also very easy to drive. It's it's it's easy to drive and and it holds us. Yeah, it's like fast super. Um thank too fast well, but i mean like you like, you know, recollect like you've seen like the videos of where, like i'd be like teselectric semi like you know, can go uphill, just be s yes, because it's reading fast like the diesel truck, ck reading cars, yeah in cars. Um so like it's responsive, it's it's you. You know you, you know you floride and the the truck actually right, but and that's a benefit, not only for for the driver and for the goods, but also for safety in terms of other drivers on the road, you don't get stuck behind the semi. You're not like yeah in ah in a slowdown situation. And on red, i mean, how that plays into you know, fsd, which is the second part of the question, all of the sei have been since to a couple hundred you've deployed already. And and the ones that we'll be building next year and throughout feature have all of the hardware in the cameras necessary to to deploy fsd. And we're currently training with that small fan that we have. And as soon as the fleet is trained in the neural that are up, you know, we'll we'll get fsd onto that platform platform. Yeah, mean, it 'll be a mass improvement in driver fatigue, you know, because and driver safety. We've got sort of the antijack nagging software. We're you know, you don't have to worry about your brakes overheating, if you go down that down a steep hill, because because the we we use regenerating like that, that energy goes back. And back and and that into the pack actually when we leave renos. And it's it's just like it's it's like radically better than than it is in some way. It's what what the drivers love it and great guys. Thank very much, but our next question is, when will tesla incorporate x and grock and all the tesla vehicles? Yeah, well, thanks. I mean, these these, these are relatively small, fry things you know, um, but yeah, with with the i think um we'll we'll keep expanding. You know what what is available on the car on on the on screen and um also improving like the browser. So like just generally, you can access anything you want in the car. In fact, for the tesla, you know, where does you get full autonomy you you want want fully AA system. That is a if you can do anything like if you want to browse internet, if you want to done, you know, ask and ask ai questions. If you want to watch a movie, if you want to play a video game, if you want to give some productivity thing, you can do anything you want and an autonomous vehicle because you don't need to drive. And so that's why the sour cap goat. I speak free and a great sound system. So you can watch it what a great movie with. It's like going like us. And i know ah in personal litatener to p post al movie theater. Um so yeah, this is why we've been building this functionality at a gaming to the car, adding m es and other, you know, all sorts of different media applications of the car, because you know, um the cars with that's what you're to. That's yeah, the cars that we built today. It's like like private games. By the way, picture really haven't tried it. It's like a castle, doombed and polytopia and a bunch of really fun games in the car. Yeah, we're we're constantly looking at. You know what features that add next, and we're paying attention to what's most commonly requested by our customers. Yeah, play castle do bad you. What we're ready it. Great. Thank you guys very much. But the next question is, elon mentioned unsupervised fsd in california and texas next year. Does that mean regulators have agreed to it in the entire state for existing hardware, three and four vehicles? No, i suppose said i was as i said earlier, california loves regulation, but they have a pathway. Yeah, i mean, there's a path where, obviously wmo operates in california. So there's just a lot of form spot and a lot of approvals that are required. Um i mean, i'd be shocked. We don't get approval next year, but it's it's just not something we we tell the control um, but i think we will get approval next year in california and texas and and and the area will branch out beyond california, texas. I mean, i think it's important to reiterate this federal or certifying a vehicle, the federal level in the us s done by meeting FB ss regulations, our vehicles today that produced autonomous capable meet those regulations. The the capital of regulations and so deployment of the vehicle to is nonlimitation. But a limitation is what you said, state level where they auautonomous deployment. Some states states relarelatively administration for texas and other other have halfways like california, that may take a little longer. Other ones haven't set up anything yet. So we will work so state by state. I do think we should have federal federal. I agree that autonomous vehicles should be approved. They should be issue possible to congress if you're listening, let's get the federal agency distribute federal approval process for autonomous vehicles. I mean, that's that's how FMBS is started to work federal motor vehicle and bss federal. Yeah. So i mean, twenty seventeen seventeen eighteen that you know one way or started looking at it, and it's really kind of stallsince. Then, but we would appreciate appreciate would support that helping out it. It really needs to be not at like a national approval is is important. You know, there's a problem of govern efficiency. I'll try to help make that problem. And you took for everyone. Not just has like this um, but you know know just ah we like. So like some some things in the US are state by state regulated, like for example, insurance, and it's like a it gets incredibly painful to do it state by state corruptty states. And and i think we should know if this should be a national approval process for autonomy. Uh point. Yes, guys. The next question is what is the plan for twenty twenty five, but i don't think we're just talking. It is, yeah, we, i mean, basically, we talked with. Doesn't there's a lot going on you. You know, dimenmention that we're working on a cheaper world to come out. I mean, they have work course. The team is doing to get the factories ready today to try and make that happen on. Yeah. Well, it didn't matter a matter of we're good fiying youtube, maybe a lower cost car is insanely high, but like it is hotter to get like twenty percent of the cost out of a car than it is to design the car and build the entire factory in the post place. It's like excruciating. And it's and and there's not a lot of movies made about that. The the heroes who got twenty percent of the cost out of a car, but let me tell you there should be. I you thank you. You unel choose everything got that is incredibly your own is little changes. And if it's not like this, yeah, and it's like they should be the the the heroes you go, twenty percent cost out of a cars like damn. I want to respect to them, but it was like movie. It's it's like, you know, i think you only could make a compelling movie, but i it just no, no like if you actually swear, how harder if people actually swear, how hard der wish to do that, you be like whoa, that's damn hard. Um just yesterday, we were talking about potty. Oh, yeah, i got honestly you're like like literally, yeah, mean, mean, been a bit this like there's a lot of, but i do call sort of like giving cost of things is kind of like it's like game of pennies. It's like game of thrones, but pennies, you know, give you the first approximation. In fact, if you've got ten thousand items in a car very on approximation and each of them costs four dollars, then you have a forty thousand dollar car. So then if you have AA, you know, a thirty five thousand dollar car, you've got to get fifty cents on average out of the ten thousand lineps, every time, every part. Yeah, it it kind of like you know. And then obviously, best is you delete some parts. In fact, we're now be able to delete a lot of parts. Oh, ah the right. I'm not very excited about the the cyber cap, designing and and and the, but you know, how how we're rethinking the design of a car for the cyber cap, designing it. Well, i will have value production. And then then desiga machine that pulls the machine that is that i think is also revolutionary. And it's just that there's no other car company that's even trying to do what we're doing like i've even heard of it. Actually, in fact, i'm certain there is some one like, like like, um i think this just our new machine that falls the machine like it's so and it's and hence inherent it like that. It's it would be designed to be like yeah at five five times better than traditional factory, like cycle time and cycle time. And like part deletion, chairman man, i don't think any other car company has the same level of like integration of thought that we have when it comes to like when you design a part from a white sheet paper who's going to bake it? Where is it gonna be made? How is it gonna be shipped? How is it gonna be assembled into the vehicle? And like at any one point, if something is done in a silo, it becomes a bottleneck of either cost or time or what efficiency, but with ah with the road taxi, you know, the development development, like we've done a good job on them. Yeah, combining all that. And then like blowing up how it's made the same, which be made this way and rethinking it. Also, it's the most efficient factory possible that shows in our it will ship in our capex efficiency when yet, when we deploy it shows in the number of parts shows the simplicity of vehicle, but also help performs and in terms of like end user state, yeah, test of blows up just on the emoji for adults. And to five, we would have stoges when flashing out and make a factory shine pii will continue to increase our storage departments. With our all three. We plan to continue expanding our supercharging network getting more oems on our network forty, six eighteen that some land, as you were talked about, that will keep going. And then if also, we also also have a lilitum refinery starting to produce. So there's a lock which is going on. I'm right, yeah, so many things. Yeah, i hear a create link. Crazy thing is like tesla winning basically on on almost every single thing we're doing um if we're not winning now, we're on trial, one in arenas with their entire lodge companies that that's the only thing they do. Yeah, i mean, it's it's a company. There are multiple companies within the top. Yeah, to those like many companies, three, one basic, and you guys just a few more ah. What is going on the tesla roadster phone things? Well, i just like to thank thank long suffering um deposit holders ders the the tessel dster. Um you know, the reason it hasn't come out yet is because it is that it roaster is not diet, not the icing on the cake. It's the cherry on the icing on the cake. And so um, you know, our our large eemission is is to accelerate the progress towards a sustainable energy future. You know, try to do things that maximize the probably the future is good for for humanity. And for earth and and um and so that necessarily means that like the things like that are kind like deserved. But we'd like like we, we all love to work on the tesla, the dek connection, tesla royster super. It's it is super fun and and we are working on a better bit. It has to come behind them. The more things the things that have a more serious impact on the good of the world. Um so just thank you to all like like suffering, tesla roroster ster deposit holders. And and we are actually finally with the progress on that. Um and we're we're we're close to finalizing the design on that. Um it's really going to be, and they expect time alone fit. You know, friend friend one, peter, teo, yeah and and and so, but sometimes people like a peer tail and our rivals were really good friends. Um to be clear, like you know, pete, peter, you know, was lamenting how you know the future doesn't have flying cars. What we'll say for it comes in great good. Bye, think very much. The next one is quick similar to other questions you've had. So when i combine it with with the final question, um so briefly, could you just detail how robotaxi will roll out? Will it start with a tesla deployed fleet and then allow customers to to add there's on the subscription model. And then we'll hardware three be capable a little fy that basically because you're in the hardware three, what we saw saw. Well, our five was it was easier to make make progress with starting with hardware, four and feeling on the solution than backporting it to hardware three, instead of directly working on hardware three, given that hardware, four as more like fundamental hardware capabilities, i think that trend will continue uh into the next few quarters as well, but we first figured solution rapidly with AA four. And then backport it right the kernels. It just takes longer to let up those things because it's not fundamentally supported in the hardware and it's emulated um, but yeah, it's initially work. No hundred four backparing at two hundred three. Yeah sounds exaggerated. We're we're not. We're not in confidential um but um but a bit are as as a short mention um because uh, but by some measures not before before, has really really as several times the capability of five and three. It's it's easier to to get things to work with hargwr um and then it takes a lot of athens to sort of squeeze that functionality into hardware three um and and that there's there is some chance that and one hundred three is does not achieve the safety level that um uh allows for unto advised FSD. You know, there's ah there was some chance of that. And and if if that turns out to the case, we will upgrading those who and bought hardman, three and the eem for free, and we have designed the system to be um upgradable. So so it's really it's really what i pick. You know, distance switches so of switch out the computer type thing um pick the camera. The cameras are okay. You know they're don't get they're capable. But um anyway, we we don't. We don't actually know the assets of that. But if it does turn out, we will technology make sure we take care of those who award efforts d on on number three, great. And in the last few minutes that we have left, we will try to get in some analyst questions. The first question will be coming from pierre fergon at new street and pierre, please feel free to unmeet yourself. Um thanks to that guys for taking my question. Um i was wondering about like um the compute your home you're ramping up. So you you gave like ah interesting statistics on how much you have. And you said you, you don't feel your compute constraint. And i was wondering, you know how you are putting to work this additional compute. Is that a game for you of creating like larger and larger models like next generation of models that are larger. The way way open ai go from GP three to gp four? Or is that more like you're set on your model? And you need to throw more and more compute to accelerate the base of learning to to improve ah reliability. Um and then i had a quick for up very quick on your rollout in texas and in the ah in california next year, the plan, as you see today ah easy to rule out like a fleet or two, um with cars that will start with like a supervisor area ah, like like some super on board supervisvision, someone sitting at the wheel, just in case and removing the supervisors polivatively. Or are you aiming for going free free fledge without even a human supersupervisor when you get started? Okay, well, i guess, regarto the of answer. Yeah, the the first part of question. The the the nature of real world, ai is ah different from CNLM in that you you have a massive amount of context. So that like the the you've you've got a case of telesthose seminary cameras that you know, mind bunch nine, if you include the tunnel camera that um that that that so you can give you birth, take abyte of context, and and that that is then distilled down into a small number of control outputs. Um you know, whereas it's it's like you don't really it's very rare to have. In fact, i'm not sure any LM out there do gigabytes of context um and then you've got to, you've got to then process that in the car with a very small amount of compute out. Um so um yeah, it's it's a it's durable. And it's happening, but it is a different problem than then. Let's say, a gemini or open ana is doing um and now part of the way you can make up for the fact that the inferced computer is as quite small. It is by spending a lot of effort on training um and just like just like a human like you, the more you train on something the less um, but the less mental workload it takes when you try it when when you when you do it like, when the the first time, like a human staris driving it absorbs at your your homelmind. But then, as you train more and more on driving, get very good, then you the driving cover becomes a background task. It doesn't it only absorbs a small amount of your mental capacity because you've a lot of training, so we can make up for the fact that the inference computers. It's it's it's tiny compared to you know, a ten kilowatt bank of gbus because you've got you've got a few hundred watts um of referenced computer. We can make up that what's um heavy training um tell. Yeah, that's a and and and and then there's also vast amounts that do the actual, you know, petabytes of data coming are tremendous um and then sorting out what training is important with. You know of the vast amounts of video training, don't everybody of data coming in fleet. What is actually most important for training? That's the squint that false um. But as ella said, we're we're not currently training compute constraint. I'm i show to one levering. Yeah, like you mentioned, the training has both train larger models, also a train quicker um but in the end, we still got to pick which models are performing better. So the validation effort to picking the models because the milestone intervention is um pretty large where to drive a lot of milestone going close to. We do have simulation and other ways to get those metrics uh those to help. But in the end, that's a big bottle lenk um yeah, that's why we're not training compare constraint around, and there's other access of scating as well, which is a data figuring out this data is more useful um that that is an important task of focusing on that. Yeah. So so as it really ates, the second part of your question here, um about safety drivers and rolling it out. Each state has different requirements that you know, in terms of how many miles and how much time you need to have a safety driver and not have a safety driver. We're gonna follow all those. We're not violate ate whatever regureguare out there, but safety as a priority. But the goal is obviously that when we're ready safety safety, is there we're going to be more attracaction from from the red chair curving? Yeah, i mean, i guess, like we we think that we'll be able to have frivolous teslas as doing paid rides next year. You have some time you to learn alright. Thank you. And our next question comes from adam jonas at morgan stanley adam, please feel free to unneed yourself. Okay, thanks, everybody, um just had a question about the relationship between tesla and xai. Many investors are still not clear how the work at xai is is truly beneficial to tesla. Some even take the view that the two companies may even be in competition with each other in terms of talent and tech and even your time, elon. So what's your message to investors on that relationship between tesla xai? And where do you see it going over time? Vex? Well, i should say that you know, xai has been helpful to tesla ai in ah you know, quite a few times in terms of stueo things like scaling up, bought it like training, you know, just ah even like recently in the last week or so, they've proven in of water training that, where if you you're doing a big training, one and and note fails, be able to continue training and um and yeah, is to recover from a train one that stanels pretty helpful um so abbin, but but there aren't different poems. And nxa is working on artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. I means tells us prime of autonomous cars and autonomous robots diamond and they're different problems. So alright ya, i mean, i think we've said this before also, like all not only i is equal right. I mean, there's air is brobroad spectrum. Yeah, we have have our swiswimlines. Yes, there are things which we we can ate, ate if needed, but for the the part part sloving different dishes. Yeah, it doesn't tell us focus on real world dance. And like let let's say, saying, yeah, it's it is quite a bit different from the an element um basically, but you have give massive context in the form video and and some other audio that's going to be distilled, right, like with with extremely efficient advanance compute. Child II do think tells us the most efficient in the world in terms of inference compute like, because at out of necessity of worthy, we have to be very good at in inorida, be icient in advance. Um we can't for ten, ten, kilowatts or g views in a car. We've got a couple hundred ones dumpk to appear out pretty pretty well designed. Tesla ai chobe um, but it's solicup hundred ones have, but but they are different problems. I mean, this was, you know, like like what please the start. The next end is like we're going just running inference. I mean, it's it's it is running. Inference, like like for answering questions answering tests to questions on ah on a ten kilowatt rack. It's like can't put down in a car. It's a different problem problem. Please. No, it's exactly um tamul. You know xa. I is because of it because i felt there wasn't it. There wasn't a truth seeking digital and superintelligence company out there like that's what it came down to and that been needed to be a true secret like like a and an ai company that is very reverfun um be truthful. It's i'm not saying xa is perfect, but that is is thbut, but that that, that is at least the explicit inspiration, a few more of surveings. You know, slitly and correct, it just will be truthful. I think this is very important for ai safety. So erratic AIX, and i will that has been coupled to tesla and will continue to be helped to tesla, but there are very different problems and great. And and and i mean mean, if you you know something like like what is like what ah what are the car company has? It has a world class trip design team like zero. One of the clock company is a world class at AI team like tesla does zero. Those were all startups. They were created for scratch. Great. Thank you milon um and i think that's unfortunately all the time that we have for today. We appreciate all your questions, and we look forward to you this quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.\"}]"
